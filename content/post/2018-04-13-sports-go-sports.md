Being an applied statistician means you often get pulled on to strange projects that are a little outside what you normally do. Making the journey from spatio-temporal modelling of air quality to spatio-temporal modelling of reef coral cover wasn't such a huge jump. Based on my experience with using splines and other related semi- and non-parametric regression techniques, I was asked by [a colleague](https://chrisdrovandi.weebly.com/) at QUT to help out on a paper being written by a PhD student at Curtin University. [Bernard Liew](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/cpr-spine/profile.aspx?ReferenceId=140172&Name=dr-bernard-liew)'s since graduated and has moved on to Birmingham but this work was related to [his thesis](https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/57365).

It's not very often that air quality scientists get a chance to work with trained physiotherapists on sport training data, but this was a really interesting piece of analysis. Chris had come to me about this PhD student he was externally supervising for some of the student's statistics work and Bernard was very keen to learn more about functional data analysis. The data that Bernard had was time series of joint power during jumping and wanted to know whether there was a difference in improvement between iso-inertial resistance and speed-power training. We shared a bit of code back and forth over Dropbox, emailed questions about splines and biomechanics and after a few rounds of revisions and targeting different journals we've ended up with a publication in PeerJ that shows that _short-term isoinertial training improved countermovement jump height more than speed-power training. The principle adaptive difference between training modalities was at the level of hip, knee and foot power absorption_ [@bernard].
