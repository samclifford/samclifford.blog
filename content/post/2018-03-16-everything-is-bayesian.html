<p><a href="http://elevanth.org/blog/2017/08/22/there-is-always-prior-information/">There is always prior information</a></p>
<ul>
<li>We never go into an experiment knowing absolutely nothing about our parameters</li>
<li>Even if we know next to nothing we can encode it</li>
<li>Don’t use stupidly vague priors (we’re all sinners)</li>
<li>Priors allow us to do more than just encode stuff from previous studies
<ul>
<li>discussion on regularisation looks a lot like the penalised likelihoods of Eilers and Marx fitting a P-spline</li>
<li>Lang, Brezger, et al. showed Bayesian splines use the same approach as P-splines</li>
</ul></li>
