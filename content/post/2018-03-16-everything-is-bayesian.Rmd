[There is always prior information](http://elevanth.org/blog/2017/08/22/there-is-always-prior-information/)

* We never go into an experiment knowing absolutely nothing about our parameters
* Even if we know next to nothing we can encode it
* Don't use stupidly vague priors (we're all sinners)
* Priors allow us to do more than just encode stuff from previous studies
    - discussion on regularisation looks a lot like the penalised likelihoods of Eilers and Marx fitting a P-spline
    - Lang, Brezger, et al. showed Bayesian splines use the same approach as P-splines
