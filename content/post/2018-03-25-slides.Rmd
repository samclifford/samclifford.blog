* https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2018/03/24/making-slides/
* Redoing slides in R Markdown
    - code chunks
	- graphs look neat
	- kable for outputting
	- consistent theme
	- references at end (used to do foonote in beamer directly)
* Print out before class, annotate along the way
    - don't transcribe
	- don't highlight
	- using a computer to replicate notes that already exist doesn't work!
* Favourite presenters
    - Graeme Pettet - a picture, hardly any maths, 3 slides for a 15 minute presentation
	- Lessig - Supreme Court Qld, lots of stuff going on in the background, but only really flashing words to emphasise a point, very well timed sequence interspersed with images for examples of points
