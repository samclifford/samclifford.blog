I'm a statistician working at <a href="http://www.qut.edu.au">Queensland University of Technology</a> on a range of environmental and environmental health problems such as jaguar conservation, reef conservation, and air pollution and its health impacts. In addition, I teach mathematics and statistics to first year science students in the unit [SEB113 - Quantitative Methods in Science](https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=SEB113).

My undergrad was in applied and computational mathematics, focussing on fluid dynamics in my honours year. Over time, I drifted towards Bayesian statistical modelling, where I use semi-parametric regression and hierarchical modelling for spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal modelling.

Occasionally, I blog about my research and you can find more about my publication history at QUT eprints and Google Scholar. Occasionally I publish useful code, including a package for tidying MCMC output from `coda` or `rjags` entitled [`mmcc`](http://mmcc.njtierney.com/).

# ACEMS 

From 2016 I have been employed as a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the QUT node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers, working on a variety of environmental statistics problems such as coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef and jaguar conservation in Peru.

## Dengue 

I am working with colleagues at QUT and <a href="http://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/diseases/mosquito-borne-viruses/">QIMR</a> to investigate the spread of Dengue fever.

## Great Barrier Reef

The Monitoring Through Many Eyes project is a collaboration between scientists, data analysts and marine explorers, working together to document, analyse and predict the health of the Great Barrier Reef. The aim is to tap into the power of Citizen Scientists by collating thousands of underwater images take by recreational divers and snorkelers on the Reef each year.

## Jaguars

The world needs new ways to do conservation. There is no time for endangered animals and their environments. We need an evidence base to make informed decisions, and we need it now. We are addressing this problem by combining traditional conservation with virtual reality technology, mathematical and statistical modelling, local knowledge and international expertise.

Through our Many Eyes on the Wild program, we aim to facilitate faster, better decisions about management and monitoring.  We are developing and using these approaches to help conserve jaguars  in the Peruvian Amazon.

## Spike sorting

## ECR Retreat

As an early career researcher (ECR) at ACEMS I helped organise the [ECR Retreat](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov) as part of the November 2017 ACEMS retreat. The ECR retreat used a blend of talks and [UnConference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) style collaborative sessions to foster collaboration between the ECRs at the [various nodes](https://acems.org.au/about-us) and to make ourselves known and avaialble to the ACEMS PhD students.

# Teaching

Since 2013 I have been involved in the development and delivery of *SEB113 - Quantitative Methods for Science* as part of the ST01 Bachelor of Science course at Queensland University of Technology. The course covers a variety of mathematical and statistical topics taught through scientific case studies and makes use of the R language for all computation.

# ILAQH 

Between 2009 and 2013 I was a **PhD student** at the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health (ILAQH) under the supervision of Professors [Lidia Morawska](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/morawska/) and [Kerrie Mengersen](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/mengerse/) and Dr [Sama Low Choy](http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/lowchoy/).

</aside>

Between 2013 and 2015 I was employed as a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at ILAQH to support the research being done across a variety of topics in air quality.

I still collaborate with colleagues at ILAQH on a variety of topics including occupational exposure, child health, atmospheric processes, exposure assessment, and instrumentation.

## Air quality and children's health

The bulk of my postdoctoral work at ILAQH was related to the UPTECH project. The project seeks to determine the effect of the exposure to airborne nano and ultrafine (UF) particles emitted from motor vehicles on the health of children in schools.
