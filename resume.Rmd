# Research 

## ACEMS {.tabset .tabset-fade }

From 2016 I have been employed as a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the QUT node of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers](http://acems.org.au/), working on a variety of environmental statistics problems such as coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef and jaguar conservation in Peru.

### Monitoring Through Many Eyes

Researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers (ACEMS), Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and the Australian Institute of Marine Science have created an immersive, virtual environment of the Great Barrier Reef. The aim of the project is to put "experts" into the virtual environment, and allow them to see and talk about what is going on in various parts of the Reef. This will allow for better decision making on what needs to be done to save the Barrier Reef.

### Many Eyes on the Wild

The world needs new ways to do conservation. There is no time for endangered animals and their environments. We need an evidence base to make informed decisions, and we need it now. We are addressing this problem by combining traditional conservation with virtual reality technology, mathematical and statistical modelling, local knowledge and international expertise. 

Through our ‘Eyes on the Wild’ program, we aim to facilitate faster, better decisions about management and monitoring.  We are developing and using these approaches to help conserve jaguars  in the Peruvian Amazon.

### Air quality

I still collaborate with colleagues at the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health (ILAQH) on a variety of topics including occupational exposure, child health, atmospheric processes, exposure assessment, and instrumentation.

## ILAQH {.tabset .tabset-fade }


Between 2010 and 2013 I was a **PhD student** at [ILAQH](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/institutes-centres-and-research-groups/international-laboratory-for-air-quality-and-health) under the supervision of Professors Lidia Morawska and Kerrie Mengersen and Dr Sama Low Choy.

Between 2013 and 2015 I was employed as a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at ILAQH to support the research being done across a variety of topics in air quality.

### UPTECH

The bulk of my postdoctoral work at ILAQH was related to the Ultrafine Particles from Traffic Emissions and Child Health  ([UPTECH](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/research-projects/uptech)) project. The project seeks to determine the effect of the exposure to airborne nano and ultrafine (UF) particles emitted from motor vehicles on the health of children in schools.

# Teaching

Since 2013 I have been involved in the development and delivery of *SEB113 - Quantitative Methods for Science* as part of the ST01 Bachelor of Science course at Queensland University of Technology. The course covers a variety of mathematical and statistical topics taught through scientific case studies and makes use of the R language for all computation.

In 2015, the teaching team was the recipient of the Vice Chancellor's Performance Award for innovation in redesiging the unit for student success through encouraging engagement with multiple technologies.
