# PhD 

Between 2010 and 2013 I completed a PhD at [ILAQH](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/institutes-centres-and-research-groups/international-laboratory-for-air-quality-and-health) under the supervision of Professors Lidia Morawska and Kerrie Mengersen and Dr Sama Low Choy.

**Thesis title**: _Spatio-temporal modelling of ultrafine particle number concentration_

**Summary**: Using the Generalised Additive Model to model temporal trends in ultrafine particle number concentration with penalised splines and spatial trends with Gaussian Markov Random fields.

## Thesis work

* @Clifford2011 - Using GAMs to model temporal trends and covariate effects for PNC in Helsinki, Finland
* @finlandpaper - A preprint of an unpublished paper looking into Bayesian GAMs with autocorrelated errors
* @paper2 - Spatio-temporal model in INLA of air pollution in Brisbane, Australia
* @phdthesis - The thesis

# ACEMS Postdoc

From 2016 I have been employed at the QUT node of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers](http://acems.org.au/), working on a variety of environmental statistics problems such as coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef and jaguar conservation in Peru.
