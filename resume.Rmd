# Research

## ACEMS Postdoc

From 2016 I have been employed at the QUT node of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers](http://acems.org.au/), working on a variety of environmental statistics problems such as coral cover in the Great Barrier Reef and jaguar conservation in Peru.

### Monitoring Through Many Eyes - Great Barrier Reef

## ILAQH Postdoc

Between 2013 and 2015 I was employed at  [ILAQH](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/institutes-centres-and-research-groups/international-laboratory-for-air-quality-and-health) as a Postdoctoral Fellow to support the research being done across a variety of topics in air quality.

### UPTECH

As with my PhD, the bulk of my postdoctoral work at ILAQH was related to the Ultrafine Particles from Traffic Emissions and Child Health  ([UPTECH](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/research-projects/uptech)) project

## PhD 

Between 2010 and 2013 I completed a PhD at ILAQH under the supervision of Professors Lidia Morawska and Kerrie Mengersen and Dr Sama Low Choy.

**Thesis title**: _Spatio-temporal modelling of ultrafine particle number concentration_

**Summary**: Using the Generalised Additive Model to model temporal trends in ultrafine particle number concentration with penalised splines and spatial trends with Gaussian Markov Random fields.

### Thesis outputs

* @Clifford2011 - Using GAMs to model temporal trends and covariate effects for PNC in Helsinki, Finland
* @finlandpaper - A preprint of an unpublished paper looking into Bayesian GAMs with autocorrelated errors
* @paper2 - Spatio-temporal model in INLA of air pollution in Brisbane, Australia
* @phdthesis - The thesis

### Coauthored outputs

These papers represent work undertaken during the PhD, typically with other PhD students within ILAQH

* @molgaard2013 - Work that came out of a visit to Helsinki, Finland, using Bayesian GAMs with autocorrelated errors to understand air quality in multiple European cities
* @farhadpaper - Spatial variation of air quality within primary schools
* @falk - Review paper on modern statistical methods for analysing spatial data
* @thermodenuder - Semi-parametric regression used to model particle losses in aerosol measuring equipment

### Conference items

* @isbaposter - Poster on spatio-temporal modelling of air quality at ISBA2012

# Teaching

## SEB113

Since 2013 I have been involved in the development and delivery of *SEB113 - Quantitative Methods for Science* as part of the ST01 Bachelor of Science course at Queensland University of Technology. The course covers a variety of mathematical and statistical topics taught through scientific case studies and makes use of the R language for all computation.

In 2015, the teaching team was the recipient of the Vice Chancellor's Performance Award for innovation in redesiging the unit for student success through encouraging engagement with multiple technologies.

* @herdsa2016 - Redesign of a first year unit with blended learning to improve student engagement and success
