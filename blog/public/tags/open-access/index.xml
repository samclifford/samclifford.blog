      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upworthy.com/one-guy-with-a-marker-just-made-the-global-warming-debate-completely-obsolete-7&#34;&gt;Here’s an interesting but simple discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the risk analysis of action on climate change. What I like is that the author encourages the viewer to play around with the outcomes rather than using an appeal to authority that states “this is what the IPCC and other climate scientists say will happen”. it’s a very Bayesian way of asking people to consider risk, not just in the conditional statement sense but in the sense that one’s personal subjective belief is viewed as a welcome addition to the discussion. So much of the climate debate seems to be based on whether or not the IPCC is right; some people don’t like that the IPCC is an international body of elite scientists and so will ignore anything they say. Couching the exercise in terms of “Any reasonable person should be able to concede that they may be wrong about the way the physical world behaves” takes it away from “who is right and who is wrong?”. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usq.edu.au/scholarships/usq/australian-postgraduate-award&#34;&gt;USQ has some APA PhD scholarships available&lt;/a&gt;, including scholarships for computational mathematics and climate risk and resource management. So if you’re interested in $30,000 per year (tax free!) to work on some interesting topics check out the USQ site. Problems with the interpretation of p values are &lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesianbiologist.com/2011/08/21/p-value-fallacy-on-more-or-less/&#34;&gt;often due to people treating them as statements about their hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; given some data when they’re really statements about the data given some hypothesis. Any SEB113 students reading would do well to remember this. I’ve also &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/2013/10/18/response-to-a-student-on-p-values/&#34; title=&#34;Response to a student on p values&#34;&gt;blogged my response&lt;/a&gt; to an SEB113 student about this. &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/15/teaching-least-squares-to-a-5th-grader-by-calibrating-a-programmable-robot/&#34;&gt;Here’s a cute little video&lt;/a&gt; about using least squares regression to figure out how many revolutions a Lego Mindstorms robot’s wheel needs to turn to make it travel 1m. It’s an interesting use of regression as a calibration technique, which is something we haven’t covered explicitly in SEB113 but I imagine it’d be pretty common in engineering classes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/10/23/why-is-grey-literature-not-open-access/&#34;&gt;Interesting post at the Thesis Whisperer&lt;/a&gt; asking why work that’s owned by someone (as in the intellectual property rights are assigned) but not copyrighted by a commercial publisher isn’t more freely available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open Access publishing is an exciting new development but like any new industry there are those who would seek to unethically make a quick fortune by providing a sub-par service. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; did some research into this by submitting a fake article with a number of glaring errors (such as non-existent institutions) in it to a number of journals around the world to see who’d accept it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/10/03/228859954/some-online-journals-will-publish-fake-science-for-a-fee?ft=1&amp;amp;f=1001&#34;&gt;The results are quite interesting&lt;/a&gt;. I know of a few instances of work published in a respectable journal being plagiarised and published in one of these scam journals and one case where the authors hastily retracted their submission once they found out the journal wasn’t anywhere near as prestigious as the editors made out. I support the goals of Open Access and web-based publication but be careful. I’ve been poking around the QUT Wiki looking for information on graduation. In the Higher Degree Research portal there’s a link to a brilliant article (three years old) on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/how-not-to-write-a-phd-thesis/410208.article&#34;&gt;how not to write a thesis&lt;/a&gt;. Probably good advice for any PhD student looking to graduate sooner rather than later. Elizabeth C. Matsui has been working with Roger Peng for several years; she has &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/08/the-care-and-feeding-of-the-biostatistician/&#34;&gt;some advice on how to cultivate a successful relationship with the biostatistician&lt;/a&gt; you’ve brought on to your medical science project. I think some of these could be adapted to be more general to cover dealing with statisticians. One of the biggest things I could add here is that you need to recognise that asking someone to “help with the statistics” means dedicating some serious time and effort to figuring out a conceptual model (which will be converted into a quantitative model) that addresses the scientific questions you wish to ask. Asking a statistician to “calculate the correlations” or even more broadly “do the statistics” is like asking a scientist to just “run an experiment” or “do the science”. These things all take time, energy and communication. Further to this, don’t just ask for p-values if you’re dealing with a statistician. P-values represent some probabilistic statement, such as “What is the probability of seeing a test statistic at least as extreme as this if the true value of the parameter was zero?”. Sure, you can do simple tests like ANOVA or Chi-Squared goodness of fit but the real value in working with a statistician is being able to develop models that represent assumptions about the data and then assessing whether those assumptions are justified and looking at the inferences that they provide. As my unit co-ordinator for SEB113 pointed out to me the other day, default hypothesis tests of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;: β = 0 at a 5% significance level may not always be sensible and may not even answer the question you’re interested in answering. And finally here’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM&#34;&gt;a video that’s almost a year old&lt;/a&gt; that shows a very interesting case of eliciting a distribution from the American public about what they perceive the distribution of wealth in their country is and what they think it is. Turns out the ideal is as far away from the perception as the perception is from the reality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Australia, at least, the impact factor of the journals you publish in plays a large role in your advance in academia. Universities are always under pressure to publish their research in more prestigious journals, conflating the impact factor of the journal and the impact of the research published in it. There are many ways journals can game their impact factor, many ways researchers can game the indices that describe the impact of their work, etc. That said, it’s always good to aim to produce research that will be accepted in a high quality journal. I’ve been excited about the PLoS journals since their launch and I believe QUT is a subscribing member, which means our publication fees are covered. It’s one of the best Open Access journal groups around and doesn’t appear to be a cash grab like some other publishers who are attempting to use Open Access as a business model to increase profits rather than because they believe in the free dissemination of research. UPTECH collected fungi and endotoxin data at the 25 schools, and we’re about to submit the fungi paper (which means work must continue on the endotoxin paper). I was considering whether we should submit to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/&#34;&gt;PLoS One&lt;/a&gt; (IF 2011: 4.092) and then had a look at what other journals they have which may be an appropriate home. I really think once we get the clinical data from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolcock.org.au/&#34;&gt;our Southern collaborators&lt;/a&gt; we should aim to do the best statistical modelling we can. I’m heartened by the fact that the head of the clinical group we’re working with has a strong background in stats and a desire to learn more Bayesian statistics. I don’t know if we can pull it off, but the prospect of having something investigating the role of fungi and endotoxin on child health published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plospathogens.org/&#34;&gt;PLoS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt; (IF 2011: 9.172) is exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/01/elements-of-statistical-learning-2nd-ed-download.html&#34;&gt;Free download&lt;/a&gt; of Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman’s “Elements of Statistical Learning”. Hastie and Tibshirani did a lot of the early work on Generalised Additive Models and non-parametric smoothing, albeit in a non-Bayesian framework, so this will no doubt be an invaluable resource. NASA have released &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-temps.html&#34;&gt;a neat visualisation&lt;/a&gt; of spatio-temporal deviation from the mean temperature going back to the 1880s. You have to be careful when generating “pretty” graphics, though, because &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/01/ugly-ugly-ugly/&#34;&gt;“pretty” infographics can be quite ugly and hard to decode&lt;/a&gt; when you’re not taking into account what the data actually represents. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/&#34;&gt;Roger Peng&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/01/16/review-of-r-graphics-cookbook-by-winston-chang/&#34;&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; Winston Chang’s “R Graphics Cookbook”. The conclusion? A pretty good collection of examples about how to complete particular graphing tasks using ggplot2. It’s a simpler book than Hadley Wickham’s “ggplot2” and would be a good introduction to using ggplot2 to achieve a particular goal. &lt;a href=&#34;http://about.jstor.org/rr&#34;&gt;JSTOR’s “Register &amp;amp; Read”&lt;/a&gt; is in beta now. So if you’re not attached to a university or other institution with a JSTOR subscription, you now have the opportunity to read JSTOR articles for free (but it’s not unlimited, at least not yet). Speaking of free access to published research, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2013/jan/17/open-access-publishing-science-paywall-immoral&#34;&gt;this opinion article&lt;/a&gt; makes the point that our job as scientists is to contribute to the body of human knowledge for the benefit of society and so if a paper isn’t freely available to the public then it isn’t really “published”. Not only that, but to hide research behind a paywall is immoral. I found it very interesting even if I thought some of his arguments were a bit dismissive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/01/a-important-new-survey-of-bayesian-predictive-methods-for-model-assessment-selection-and-comparison/&#34;&gt;A very comprehensive paper by Vehtari and Ojanen discusses various aspects of model assessment and comparison&lt;/a&gt;. I was mentioning to a friend the other day that I don’t think model assessment is taught very well in first year statistics classes. I recognise that you can’t teach everything in a first year class, but I think we should be going beyond R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as a summary of model performance. Even the AIC would be a good start, as it incorporates a trade-off between goodness of fit and model complexity. I am yet to fully read the paper but it’s something I should definitely get my head around. &lt;a href=&#34;http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/advice-how-to-review-a-manuscript-for-a-journal/&#34;&gt;Dynamic Ecology has some advice for how to review a journal article&lt;/a&gt;. This will become increasingly relevant for me as a junior researcher. No doubt I’ll be asked whether I could review some submitted articles for a journal in which I am publishing my papers. Having not done it before, the first one will no doubt be the toughest. Perhaps I should ask the more junior reviewer of my thesis panel for any recent experience they’ve had. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/01/09/jstor-offer-limited-free-access-content-1200-journals&#34;&gt;JSTOR’s “Register &amp;amp; Read”&lt;/a&gt; program is an attempt to open up access to academic publishing by allowing individuals not affiliated with an organisation with a JSTOR subscription to read three articles every two weeks for free. This will be good for when news articles discuss a study and people are interested enough to go and find the original paper but don’t want to drop $30 to read it. It’s not as far-reaching as Open Access but it’s a good step. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search/%23overlyhonestmethods&#34;&gt;#OverlyHonestMethods&lt;/a&gt; is a hilarious Twitter hashtag that is encouraging scientists to confess their transgressions and is &lt;a href=&#34;http://io9.com/5974256/overlyhonestmethods-is-the-postsecret-of-the-science-world-and-it-is-amazing&#34;&gt;being called&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postsecret.com/&#34;&gt;PostSecret&lt;/a&gt; of the science world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first issue of the official ISIAQ journal, &lt;a href=&#34;http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-INA.html&#34;&gt;Indoor Air&lt;/a&gt;, arrived on my desk this morning. There are some interesting articles but I’m not particularly likely to thumb through a paper journal very often. I prefer getting an electronic copy where I can use the “Find” command to look for phrases and words in which I have a research interest. They offer an online version of the journal, so I wonder if I can contact ISIAQ and let them know I don’t want a paper copy of the journal. Again, I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/&#34;&gt;Bayesian Analysis&lt;/a&gt; is providing a good service by providing their journal as an online, Open Access resource. Edit: Oh no. I’ve just found a very bad graph. The below figure is from Batterman et al (2012) “&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00760.x/full&#34;&gt;Sources, concentrations, and risks of naphthalene in indoor and outdoor air&lt;/a&gt;”. Plots based on empirical cumulative density functions should always be checked to ensure that the resulting functions are monotonic. [caption id=“attachment_398” align=“aligncenter” width=“330”][&lt;img src=&#34;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ina_760_f4.gif&#34; title=&#34;INA_760_f4&#34; /&gt;](ina_760_f4.gif) Distributions of indoor naphthalene levels in the four study cities. Sample size = 288 (Battermen et al., 2012)[/caption] Check the plot for Ypsilanti around 75-90%. Those dips should not be there. I’m guessing it’s just a weird artifact of the way they generated the ecdf, but it’s sloppy statistics and I can’t believe the reviewer missed it. Indoor Air has an impact factor of 2.55 and was ranked as A* in 2010 by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arc.gov.au/era/default.htm&#34;&gt;ARC&lt;/a&gt;. I know the impact factor only relates to citations and it’s one graph in a single issue but I always find this sort of thing disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a lot of my time since Healthy Buildings finished revising the semi-parametric forecasting paper. We had submitted to Annals of Applied Statistics but it was rejected. We got some very useful comments back from the reviewer, though, and I think it’s a much stronger paper now. The reviewer encouraged us to rewrite the paper with a focus on the methodology rather than the application and submit it to a more theoretical journal. I have just submitted it to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/&#34;&gt;Bayesian Analysis&lt;/a&gt; (IF: 1.650), the official journal of &lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesian.org&#34;&gt;ISBA&lt;/a&gt;, and uploaded the preprint to arXiv (where it will replace the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0558&#34;&gt;current version&lt;/a&gt; in the next 24 hours). As an Open Access journal with a well-written LaTeX document class, Bayesian Analysis is a journal I can get behind. Some very good papers have appeared there and as Bayesian statistics continues to grow as a field (and ISBA as a society) I think we can expect to see BA really take off as a journal. So much of modern statistics is algorithms rather than proofs and making these available to people, particularly people who aren’t academics, with freely available, peer reviewed papers will help improve the statistical capabilities of modern science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m setting up a laptop to take to ISBA with me as I have lots of thesis work to do. I must say, I’m really impressed with GitHub for Windows in regards to how simple it is to set up. It’s a matter of installing the program itself, then entering your github details. Cloning your GitHub repositories to your local machine is as simple as pressing a button. I haven’t had to faff about with ssh, pageant, etc. Now I just have to finish setting up remote INLA (which will require faffing about with ssh), installing LaTeX and figuring out if I can use X forwarding without X-Win. I also have to finish my ISBA poster and organise for it to be printed. Then there’s the two talks I am giving at Healthy Buildings 2012 which need writing and the Student Program work. I leave for Japan on Sunday. I should probably look at train travel from Osaka to Kyoto, find my travel money card, passport, etc. I uploaded a paper to arXiv yesterday. I’ll post about it here when it appears.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://xianblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/new-elsevier-journal/&#34;&gt;Christian Robert has just blogged&lt;/a&gt; about a new Elsevier journal - &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.journals.elsevier.com/spatial-statistics/&#34;&gt;Spatial Statistics&lt;/a&gt;. I think the idea of a dedicated spatial statistics journal is fantastic, but I don’t like that Open Access publishing in this journal will cost at least $3000, that the institutional subscription rate is around $650 per year and that authors can post the final version of the text (not the published paper, which is fair enough) on their personal or institutional website but not on the arXiv (so good luck with that if you’re at a university that doesn’t keep up with the times) (but you can post pre-prints to the arXiv). With mild regret, I won’t be submitting to either Spatial Statistics or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.journals.elsevier.com/spatial-and-spatio-temporal-epidemiology/&#34;&gt;Spatial and Spatio-temporal Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, even though these two journals are right up my alley and published by a respected&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;em&gt;by whom?&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt; publisher&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got some substantial feedback from one of my supervisors earlier in the week and I’ve been chopping and changing this paper to ensure that the results section is more than just “Look at these graphs. They are graphs.” and that the introduction actually introduces the problem before leaping into how we propose to solve it. Another one of my supervisors will always pick me up on my use of informal language. I tend to write as if I’m explaining how I went about solving a problem, which is very well suited to tutorials, blogging and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/npbayes/home&#34;&gt;NP Bayes Wiki&lt;/a&gt; (the reading group is currently on hiatus) but less well suited to academic papers which will be sent to peer reviewed journals. I need to keep working on my formal scientific writing. Part of that probably means reading more academic papers from start to finish rather than skimming them for the information that I need. It probably also doesn’t help that most of the methodological stuff that I’m writing is drawn from the documentation and FAQs of an R package as well as personal communication with the authors of said package (said package is &lt;a href=&#34;www.r-inla.org&#34;&gt;R-INLA&lt;/a&gt;). I’ve got three papers on the go at the moment, so it’s going to be important that I can pick the low-hanging fruit of avoiding informal language so that my supervisors can concentrate on the actual work when giving me feedback. I’ve recently been spending a fair amount of time thinking about, and discussing with some colleagues, the issues of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecostofknowledge.com/&#34;&gt;Elsevier boycott&lt;/a&gt;, open access publishing and the use of preprint repositories like &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;. QUT supports open access to some extent by running an &lt;a href=&#34;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/&#34;&gt;ePrints&lt;/a&gt; repository, where university researchers are encouraged to deposit a preprint of their work (not the version published by the journal), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://libguides.library.qut.edu.au/content.php?pid=84068&amp;amp;sid=624559&#34;&gt;subscribing to, or taking out membership with&lt;/a&gt;, a few open access journals. Some of these are quite highly regarded, particularly publications by the Public Library of Science, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/home.action&#34;&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of our papers at ILAQH end up in Elsevier’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.journals.elsevier.com/atmospheric-environment/&#34;&gt;Atmospheric Environment&lt;/a&gt;, quite a respectable journal, but I feel uncomfortable propping up a business with such a coercive business model that allows them to operate at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/science/researchers-boycott-elsevier-journal-publisher.html?_r=1&#34;&gt;profit level of 36&lt;/a&gt;%. Sure, Adam Smith tells us that the baker is a baker not out of a love of bread but out of a desire to earn money with which to live, but we don’t have to accept the terms of business of one large company. I’m particularly interested in journals where the authors retain the copyright (or in the case of QUT, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_03_01.jsp#D_03_01.05.mdoc&#34;&gt;the authors’ institution&lt;/a&gt;). I’m also a fan of journals which are innovating in the modern publishing environment, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amstat.org&#34;&gt;American Statistical Association&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstatsoft.org/&#34;&gt;Journal of Statistical Software&lt;/a&gt; which is not only open access but publishes each article as its own issue of the journal, increasing the frequency of publication to a point where when an article’s reviewed it’s published straight away. I don’t like Elsevier’s business model and would be happy to look at publishing in high quality open access journals where the authors don’t have to sign away their copyright to the publishers. After all, it’s not the journals funding or doing the work. I believe granting the publishers a time-limited exclusive license to publish would be a far better model. There are other journals with a similar level of credibility and respect that don’t require authors to sign over copyright, don’t coerce libraries into taking big packages with unwanted journals bundled in and don’t freeze the person in the street out of reading the results of publicly funded research (a lot of research in Australia is funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arc.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, a government funding body). I don’t think Elsevier are evil, but they have a terrible business model in terms of disseminating high quality research to the public in an affordable manner. There are others out there doing a better job and researchers should support them.&lt;/p&gt;
