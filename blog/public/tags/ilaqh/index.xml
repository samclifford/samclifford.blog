      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been spending a bit of time over the last few days making an R tutorial for the members of my air quality research group. Rather than being a very general introduction to the use of R, e.g. file input/output, loops, making objects, I’ve decided to show a very applied workflow that involves the actual data analysis and explaining ideas as we go along. Part of this philosophy is that I’m not going to write a statistics tutorial, opting instead to point readers to textbooks that deal with first year topics such as regression models and hypothesis tests. It’s been a very interesting experience, and it’s meant having to deal with challenges along the way such as PDF graphs that take up so much file space for how (un-)important they are to the overall guide and, thinking about how to structure the tutorial so that I can assume zero experience with R but some experience with self-directed learning. The current version can be seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/tutorial-20151221.pdf&#34; title=&#34;tutorial-20151221&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. One of the ideas that Sama Low Choy had for SEB113 when she was unit coordinator and lecturer and I was just a tutor, was to write a textbook for the unit because there wasn’t anything that really covered our approach. Since seeing computational stats classes in the USA being hosted as repositories on GitHub I think it might be possible to use R Markdown or GitBook to write an R Markdown project that could be compiled either as a textbook with exercises or as a set of slides.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Workshops</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a very full week last week, with the annual &lt;a href=&#34;https://botb2015.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Bayes on the Beach&lt;/a&gt; (BOB) at the Gold Coast (Mon-Wed) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bode2015.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Bayesian Optimal Design of Experiments&lt;/a&gt; (BODE) on Friday. BOB is an annual workshop/retreat, run by Kerrie Mengersen and the BRAG group at QUT, that brings together a bunch of Australian and international statisticians for a few days of workshops, tutorials, presentations and fun in the sun. This year was, I think, my fourth year at BOB. One of the recurring features is the workshop sessions, where around three researchers each pose a problem to the group and everyone decides which one they’re going to work on. This year I was asked to present a problem based on the air quality research I do and so my little group worked on the issue of how to build a predictive model of indoor PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; based on meteorology, outdoor PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and temporal information. We were fortunate to have &lt;a href=&#34;http://dicook.github.io/&#34;&gt;Di Cook&lt;/a&gt; in our group, who did a lot of interesting visual analysis of the data (she later presented a tutorial on how to use ggplot and R Markdown). We ended up discussing why tree models may not be such a great idea, the difference in autocorrelation and the usefulness of distributed lag models. It gave me a lot to think about and I hope that everyone found it as valuable as I did. The two other workshop groups worked on ranking the papers of Professor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~nrjb2/&#34;&gt;Richard Boys&lt;/a&gt; (one of the keynote speakers) and building a Bayesian Network model of PhD completion time. Both groups were better attended than mine, which I put down to the idea that those two were “fun” workshops and mine sounded a lot like work. Still, a diverse range of workshops means something for everyone. &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/mcgreej/&#34;&gt;James McGree (QUT)&lt;/a&gt; asked me if I could come to the BODE workshop to discuss some open challenges in air quality research with regards to experimental design. I gave a brief overview of regulatory monitoring, the UPTECH project’s random spatial selection and then brought in the idea that the introduction of low cost sensors gives us the opportunity to measure in so many places at once but we still need to sort out where we want to measure if we want to characterise human exposure to air pollution. While it was a small group I did get to have a good chat with the attendees about some possible ways forward. It was also good to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://data.aims.gov.au/staffcv/jsf/external/view.xhtml?partyId=900000428&#34;&gt;Julian Caley (AIMS)&lt;/a&gt; talk about monitoring on the Great Barrier Reef, Professor &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/pettitt/&#34;&gt;Tony Pettitt (QUT)&lt;/a&gt; talk about sampling for intractable likelihoods and &lt;a href=&#34;http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/perez5/&#34;&gt;Tristan Perez (QUT)&lt;/a&gt; discuss the interplay between experimental design and the use of robots. It’s been a great end to the year to spend it in the company of statisticians working on all sorts of interesting problems. While I do enjoy my air quality work and R usage is increasing at ILAQH it’s an entirely different culture to being around people who spend their time working out whether they’re better off with data.table and reshape2 or dplyr and tidyr.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Has it already been a year? This week the Australia-China Centre for Air Quality Science and Management had its second annual meeting, at QUT. We got updates on the various research activities that have happened, are happening and are planned. There’s lots of interesting stuff being done to tackle a variety of problems, such as reducing workplace exposure to air pollution, quantifying the exposure of individuals and using unmanned aerial vehicles to measure air quality. &lt;img src=&#34;img_1215.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_1215.jpg&#34; /&gt; Tuesday night we had the conference dinner out at the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens, at the function space at the cafe/restaurant out there. I don’t think I’ve been there since my cousin’s wedding reception 15-20 years ago. I really liked that efforts were made to ensure each table had a mix of senior professors, mid- and early-career researchers and PhD students. It made for a very inclusive dinner and many different topics of conversation. Luckily I was sat with a co-worker with whom I could trade my fish entree and mains for something a little more land-based. There was even a birthday cake (chocolate mousse cake) and a number of people joined in singing “Happy Birthday” to the ACC. Wednesday we spent the day workshopping the various planned projects to determine what issues need to be addressed in the collection and analysis of data. I ended up sitting with a group looking at the impacts of indoor temperature on mortality rates, particularly trying to estimate the relative risk of extreme heat and cold. It was good to be confronted with some new challenges to think about, rather than the same stuff I’ve been working on almost non-stop this year. All in all, it was a good meeting even though the stress levels around here were through the roof in the lead-up. I ended up taking photos of nearly all of the presenters on the Tuesday as well as group photos with our Chinese collaborators and special invited guests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent the last few days travelling to and from Beijing, China for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qut.edu.au/institute-of-health-and-biomedical-innovation/about/news/news?news-id=83099&#34;&gt;launch of the new Australia-China Centre for Air Quality Science and Management.&lt;/a&gt; This is a huge thing for us at ILAQH because it sets up an international collaborative agreement between a bunch of institutions in Australia and China who each have a different set of expertise that they can bring to the table, allowing us to undertake more ambitious projects than before and seek funding from a wider range of sources. There was a lot of prep and behind the scenes meetings to take place on the first day, so Mandana (a colleague of mine) and I took a trip downtown to the Forbidden City and Tian Anmen Square and did some shopping Wangfujin. It would have been cold enough without the wind but it was such a clear day and everything was wonderful. &lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/q1zV8c&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://flic.kr/p/q1zV8c&lt;/a&gt; The first day of the launch, held at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.craes.cn/cn/english/welcome.html&#34;&gt;CRAES&lt;/a&gt;, featured the constituent groups giving a short presentation about their work. There’s a lot of great people working on some really interesting stuff and I’m very excited about the prospect of working with some of them over the coming years. &lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/q26qn7&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://flic.kr/p/q26qn7&lt;/a&gt; The second day had us split into three groups to propose various objectives and projects and put names on paper for who might be good leaders or key players in these fields as part of our centre. I joined the Transport Emissions group to discuss the control of emissions at their source, the investigation of atmospheric transformation processes and the development and uptake of new technologies. A lot of the ground work had already been laid at a planning meeting earlier in the year but it was good to put together some more concrete research topics. After this, we went out to the National Jade Hotel for dinner, where we got to try another of the varied styles of Chinese cuisine; this time from a coastal region in North-Eastern China. I wish I had’ve paid more attention to the names of the various styles, but I enjoyed trying everything over the course of the trip, even the tripe. &lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/pntrDK&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://flic.kr/p/pntrDK&lt;/a&gt; The final day saw us tidying up the proposals, and an early finish meant that I got the afternoon off with Mandana, Felipe and Dion. After stumbling our way through a menu with pictures but no English translations, we had a big lunch and set off on the subway to the Temple of Heaven. It was certainly warmer than the Forbidden City (less stone, more trees) and was a very peaceful and pleasant end to the trip as we sat down at a bakery café and discussed If You Are The One while eating cream buns and drinking coffee (or in my case, peach black tea with milk). After heading back to the hotel, Mandana and I took a walk around the Bird’s Nest stadium which was only a block from our hotel. It looks like Beijing is putting effort into maintaining the area as a public plaza rather than just the grounds of a sports stadium, so even late in the cold evening it was full of families and groups of friends walking, talking and taking photographs. &lt;a href=&#34;https://flic.kr/p/q3vTaT&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://flic.kr/p/q3vTaT&lt;/a&gt; An early morning taxi to the airport saw the start of 18 hours of travel. It’s nice to be back in one’s own bed, but I’m off to the airport again tomorrow for a 5:30am flight to Sydney for a workshop on exposure assessment with colleagues from the Centre for Air quality and health Research and evaluation. After a week of disastrously bad coffee, I’m glad that I booked accommodation which advertises itself as being 15m from the Toby’s Estate café.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The full paper from the EMAC2013 conference last year is now available online. If you’re interested in the statistical methodology we used for estimating the inhaled dose of particles by students in the UPTECH project, you should check out our paper at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://journal.austms.org.au/ojs/index.php/ANZIAMJ/article/view/7819&#34;&gt;ANZIAM Journal&lt;/a&gt; (click the link that says “PDF” down the bottom under Full Text). More importantly, though, we were successful in applying for an ARC Discovery Project! This project will run for three years and combines spatio-temporal statistical modelling, sensor miniaturisation and mobile phone technologies to allow people to minimise their exposure to air pollution. Our summary of the project, from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arc.gov.au/pdf/DP15/DP15_Listing_by_State_and_Org.pdf&#34;&gt;the list of successful projects&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interdisciplinary project aims to develop a personalised air pollution exposure monitoring system, leveraging the ubiquitousness and advancements in mobile phone technology and state of the art miniaturisation of monitoring sensors, data transmission and analysis. Airborne pollution is one of the top contemporary risks faced by humans; however, at present individuals have no way to recognise that they are at risk or need to protect themselves. It is expected that the outcome will empower individuals to control and minimise their own exposures. This is expected to lead to significant national socioeconomic benefits and bring global advancement in acquiring and utilising environmental information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people at ILAQH were also successful in getting a Discovery Project grant looking at new particle formation and cloud formation in the Great Barrier Reef. I won’t be involved in that project but it sounds fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Revising another paper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We got a paper back from the reviewers a few days ago and there are some comments requesting revisions to the explanation of the statistical methods and the analysis. It’s interesting coming back to this paper, about a year after I last saw it (it’s been sent around to a few different journals to try to find a home for it). The PhD student who is the main author got into R and ggplot2 last year and has done some good work with linear mixed effects models and visualisation but some of the plots are the same sort of thing one might do in Excel (lots of boxplots next to each other rather than making use of small multiples). So now I get to delve back into some data and analysis that’s about a year old with fresh eyes. Having done more with ggplot2 over the last 12 months, there are some things that I will definitely change about this. The student and I had a chat this morning about how to tackle it, and we’re trying to choose the best way to split up our data for visualisation: 6 treatments, 4 measurement blocks, two different measures (PM2.5 mass concentration and PNC), a total of 48 boxplots, density plots or histograms. A paper with another PhD student has had its open discussion finalised now, which means more writing is probably going to happen. I find &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/&#34;&gt;ACP&lt;/a&gt;’s model quite interesting. The articles are peer reviewed, published for discussion, and then revised by the authors for final publication. I guess it spreads the review work out a bit and allows for multiple voices to be heard before final publication, each with a different approach and background.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning different programming languages</title>
      <link>/./2014/07/02/learning-different-programming-languages/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>/./2014/07/02/learning-different-programming-languages/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest changes I noticed moving from doing statistics in Minitab (in first year data analysis) to doing statistics in R (in third year statistical inference) was that R encourages you to write functions. Normally this is done by writing functions in R’s own language (that call other functions, also written in R, which eventually call functions written in C) but it’s also possible to make use of other languages to do the heavy lifting. This isn’t unique to R, of course; MATLAB encourages the use of MEX files to improve run-times when you need to call the same custom function over and over again. I’ve really only used high level languages to do my statistics, making use of other peoples’ optimised code that do the things that I want. I’ve seen the development of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/43469/&#34;&gt;pyMCMC&lt;/a&gt; by reseachers at QUT and someone from my NPBayes reading group made quite heavy use of RCpp in his thesis. Python and C++ are probably the two languages that would be the most useful to learn given their ubiquity and reputation. I have been putting off learning these for years as I know that there’s a large time investment required to become proficient in programming and no external pressure to learn (unlike learning R as part of my PhD thesis work). There’s no doubt that writing optimised code is a desirable thing to do, and that knowing more than one programming language (and how to use them together) gives you a much richer toolbox for numerically solving problems. I’m now at a point, though, where it looks like I may need to bite the bullet and pick up C++. JAGS, which I use through rjags in R, is a stable, fast platform for MCMC-based inference. It’s written in C++ and notifies you every time you load it in R that it has loaded the basemod and bugs modules. There are additional modules available (check in -3.4.064) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cidlab.com/prints/wabersich2013extending.pdf&#34;&gt;it’s possible to write your own&lt;/a&gt;, as long as you know C++. I’m at a point with the work I’ve been doing on &lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es403721w&#34;&gt;estimating personal dose of ultrafine particles&lt;/a&gt; that I’d like to make the modelling more Bayesian, which includes figuring out a way to include the deposition model in the MCMC scheme (as I’d like to put a prior on the shape parameter of the reconstructed size distribution). My options seem to be either writing a JAGS module that will allow me to call a C++ified version of the function or to abandon JAGS and write a Gibbs sampler (or Metropolis-Hastings, but Gibbs will likely be quicker given the simplicity of the model I’m interested in). Either solution will stretch me as a programmer and probably give me a better understanding of the problem. Eubank and Kupresanin’s “Statistical Computing in C++ and R” is staring at me from the shelf above my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Web presence</title>
      <link>/./2013/12/13/web-presence/</link>

      <author>Alexander Ivanov</author>
      <guid>/./2013/12/13/web-presence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first met the friend who’s going to try learning R over the summer by way of a blog that she and a mutual friend of ours ran way back in the day. She recently posted a link to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/11/guardian-10-year-blog-project&#34;&gt;a Guardian article&lt;/a&gt; about cringing at the blogs we (as a society) had ten years ago and mused a bit on her old group blog. Ten years ago I was being introduced to Livejournal by a fellow engineering student at QUT but as far back as 2000 I was dabbling in blogging and writing webpages. Fed up with some of the attitudes at our high school, a friend and I had joined a webring, where we wrote terrible poetry, passable HTML/CSS and banal updates about the coding of our respective webpages. I’m definitely not going to post a link and I’m glad I never used my name on that site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago (almost to the day, according to the source) the first version of the ILAQH website went live. If you’re reading this beyond Monday 16 you may not be able to see what I can see now. Below is a screen grab of what I see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ilaqh.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ilaqh.png?w=625&#34; title=&#34;ILAQH website 2003-2013&#34; alt=&#34;ilaqh&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website seems to have not had a design refresh in the last ten years, on account of various factors to do with QUT’s IT policies, not having a postdoc who’s also a professional web designer, etc. ILAQH has been around in one form or another since 1995, which means that as much as I cringe looking at the layout of our old site it could have been much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/institutes-centres-and-research-groups/international-laboratory-for-air-quality-and-health&#34;&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; that thematically fits with the rest of QUT’s web presence and is much more appropriate for a university research group who publish good quality work in the top journals in their field, have organised an international conference recently, and have a string of ARC Discovery grant successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly a good web presence is important for research groups but it’s increasingly becoming more important for individual researchers. It’s a way to connect with potential employers, students, colleagues, etc. and a high quality site can really show what sets you apart from others. I’m trying to convince some of the other people at my sort of academic level to get their own websites so that they’re easily searchable online and have a page that’s separate from any university affiliation but also not tied to any one social network (not even the professional ones like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel_Clifford/&#34;&gt;ResearchGate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://lnkd.in/pWZfxy&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all the blogs and web presences I’ve had, I’m definitely proudest of this one and doubt that in ten years time I’ll be looking back at it and cringing. I’m not a professional web developer, just someone who’s got a Wordpress account and a bit of experience mucking around with software. Any researcher has the skills required to come up with a website for themselves and their research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/./2013/10/11/talks/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’ve discussed this before but there’s a huge difference in culture between the two research groups I’m involved with. ILAQH (physics) meets once every four to six months at the moment and BRAG (statistics) meets fortnightly. At the fortnightly meetings we spend a few minutes having a quick check-in around the room where we discuss what we’ve been up to for the last two weeks (any papers published, talks given, new research plans) and then someone will give a talk on a topic that is within a semester-long theme. The theme last semester was visualisation, now we’re moving on to the analysis of big data. ILAQH, by contrast, meets at a frequency that doesn’t really facilitate a catch-up. Instead, any big developments in the big projects are discussed and visitors are welcomed and/or farewelled appropriately. Both meetings serve different purposes in different ways. One of the biggest benefits of the BRAG fortnightly meetings is that PhD students get a lot of practice giving talks. You’re almost expected to give a talk once a semester, and students are encouraged to give practice talks for the milestones of their PhD candidature (confirmation at 12 months, final seminar when completed). Given that it’s typically two and a half years between confirmation and the final seminar, being expected to give a talk every few months means that you get practice at talking and that the practice is somewhat regular. This will be especially important for ILAQH students as an overwhelming majority of our students are not native English speakers. Getting regular practice at academic speaking will help when it comes to final seminars. I’ve spoken to Lidia Morawska (Director of ILAQH) about setting up such a system and she thinks it’s a good idea. Now I’ve just got to check that the rest of the group sees it as valuable and then put the legwork in to get it off the ground (organise a time, book a room, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are only four months left in my current postdoctoral appointment and I’m discussing plans for next year with my supervisor. There’s still a lot of unfinished UPTECH work that needs to happen, including helping a handful of PhD students with the stats in their papers for their thesis, dealing with the clinical data and putting together some research plans for what to do next. The plan at the moment is to look for some funding both internally and externally to provide a research appointment. I’m also interested in continuing lecturing next year, whether in SEB113 or another mathematics/statistics unit. Most of ILAQH is away as of today or tomorrow, as they travel to Prague for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://eac2013.cz/&#34;&gt;2013 European Aerosol Conference&lt;/a&gt;. The work that I’ve been doing with some colleagues from ILAQH and Italy, on personal sampling, will be featured on a poster. The paper has been submitted to ES&amp;amp;T but hasn’t been accepted yet, so unfortunately I can’t put a preprint up to show off the cool statistics that I had to learn to do the modelling in the paper. As a result of everyone being away, I’ll be one of two academic staff members left here. It’s going to be quiet, with most of the staff and a few PhD students gone. Barring the Finnish paper that I’m still revising, this personal sampling paper has been the paper which has required the most creative and original programming as there have been many different steps along the way. I am particularly proud of this paper and the work that went into it. When I was first brought on board there didn’t appear to be much clarity regarding what we wanted to investigate; we had a lot of personal sampling data but didn’t quite know what to do with it. I think the paper we’ve developed does service to the amount of work that was put into collecting the data and is aligned with what the UPTECH project was set up to do. I’m grateful to all co-authors on the paper (and everyone who was out there in the schools) for the work that they put into bringing this to fruition. I’m still finishing the final corrections for my thesis, due in a few weeks time. After that’s handed in I’ll be taking another step in becoming a grown-up academic: supervising a PhD student. I’ll be the replacement associate supervisor for a student whose original associate supervisor has moved from QUT to another university. QUT requires an internal primary and associate supervisor and I’m the one most familiar with the modelling that this student is doing as part of their thesis. We’ve already set a meeting schedule for the time when his primary supervisor is overseas and have discussed what sort of things I’ll expect to see. It’s a strange responsibility to have for someone who’s only just finishing up their thesis. I wonder how long it will be until I’m the primary supervisor for a student. Two years? Five? Ten? Worrying about funding, writing grant applications, supervising students, lecturing (writing assessment!). It’s a strange place to find oneself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had some Posterior Samples to share before going on leave but didn’t get around to posting them. Here’s what’s been on my mind this month: Maths and science units are popular with (Kentucky) students until they realise that &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/07/08/math-science-popular-until-students-realize-theyre-hard/&#34;&gt;they’re hard&lt;/a&gt;. While not directly relevant to the Australian university education model it’s probably an important thing for the Science and Engineering Faculty to keep in mind. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/07/08/math-science-popular-until-students-realize-theyre-hard/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I’m looking at ggplot2 more these days, so the idea of a “grammar of graphics” is beginning to resonate with me. &lt;a href=&#34;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyGggdg31mc&#34;&gt;Here’s a talk&lt;/a&gt; about building one for &lt;a href=&#34;http://clojure.org/&#34;&gt;clojure&lt;/a&gt; (which I don’t use). Something for me to keep in mind when delivering SEB113 slides this semester is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/p0sgdgo7mxkoj4h/What%20your%20math%20slides%20dont%20need.pdf&#34;&gt;what your maths slides don’t need&lt;/a&gt;. Probably also good pointers for any PhD students graduating soon. &lt;a href=&#34;http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/the-kitchen-as-a-pollution-hazard/&#34;&gt;An interesting article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; about air pollution from cooking. This is something that ILAQH has a research interest in and our nanotracer paper contains a bit of analysis of inhaled surface area dose from particles that originate from cooking. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html&#34;&gt;Another NYT article&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a delicious visualisation of the geographical trends in income disparity and social mobility. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/statistics_and_psychology_multiple_comparisons_give_spurious_results.html&#34;&gt;Andrew Gelman writes at Slate&lt;/a&gt; about some of the problems with scientific publishing and the publication of spurious findings (which isn’t always willingly dishonest). A special “Big Bayes Stories” issue of “Statistical Science” will be published soon, focussing on the real world application of Bayesian statistics where other methods were inapplicable. &lt;a href=&#34;http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/big-bayes-stories/&#34;&gt;Christian Robert has written the preface&lt;/a&gt;; the issue is being edited by Robert, Kerrie Mengersen (one of my PhD supervisors) and Sharon McGrayne, author of “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Theory-That-Would-Not-Die/dp/1452636850&#34;&gt;The Theory That Would Not Die&lt;/a&gt;”. Also I went to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.questacon.edu.au/&#34;&gt;Questacon&lt;/a&gt; and it was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on leave next week so am attempting to spend today and tomorrow getting ready some things finished before I disappear. This means finishing my contribution to two papers by one of the UPTECH PhD students, finding a new home for our personal sampling paper (Environmental Health Perspectives didn’t want it), getting SEB113 material ready for our 67 students next semester, contacting collaborators interstate about data, getting some Bayesian Network elicitation typed up and helping various PhD students with their data anlysis. It has been quite full on despite my supervisor being overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now at the half-way point in my year-long postdoctoral fellowship. Since the start of the year the number of papers submitted with my name on them has approximately doubled, I’ve got my name on some grant applications (some successful, some not) and am co-writing a proposal for a PhD student position at ILAQH that I will likely end up co-supervising. It’s been quite the experience so far and it’s really only just getting started. I’ve been applying for lecturing positions at QUT and will continue to look further afield to see what’s out there that inspires me. Today the staff and post-docs in my group had a meeting to discuss the handling of lab business and how we maintain our space. For the longest time I’ve felt like a bit of an outsider, particularly with regards to lab stuff. I couldn’t tell you how to maintain a CPC, what the difference between a P-trak and Q-trak is or how to compare SMPS to NSAM data. I was not a member of the measurement team for UPTECH and my involvement in the research is mainly through data analysis and statistical consultation. Being given responsibilities within the lab is still a bit strange to me but I’m very happy to be helping out, as I am part of a team and I rely on those around me for my work. Statistics doesn’t happen in a vacuum (unless you’re a probabilist). A friend of a friend is finishing up their chemistry PhD and looking for work for next semester and beyond. They’re applying for a more technical job and we spent some time this evening with our mutual friend (who has recently started a postdoc) discussing how to rearrange the CV in order to best highlight their experience. I showed &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/?attachment_id=291&#34;&gt;my own CV&lt;/a&gt; to explain what I wanted to highlight, as all three of us had different opinions on style, format, the flow of the text and whether to include a photograph or not. Obviously I’m pitching myself at academic, rather than technical, positions and I said that I believe professional experience in a lab is far more important to show off than academic awards from undergrad. An interesting moment in the conversation was the disbelief from the friend of a friend that I would make my CV so public. Why wouldn’t I want to show the world who I am, what I’m working on and what I’m interested in? It appears that developing multiple versions of a CV is necessary in order to have something to send to different bodies. University faculties are looking for a very different set of attributes than the Australian Research Council or other funding groups. I haven’t yet managed to whittle my CV down to two pages but I suspect it would include removing much of the tutoring and undergraduate experience I’ve had, my radio and TV interviews and conference organisation background, focussing instead on my top publications, professional experience and track record with grants. I will continue to need to tweak my CV as I continue to apply for jobs and this means having a look around for good resources from those who have gone before me. Some examples of advice I’ve come across are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://theresearchwhisperer.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/postdoc-chances/&#34;&gt;Boost your postdoc chances (at The Research Whisperer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2011/05/26/what-if-your-cv-is-not-enough-part-one/&#34;&gt;What if your CV is not enough? (at The Thesis Whisperer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trockeneisbombe.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/the-transit-from-phd-student-to-post-doc/&#34;&gt;The transit from PhD student to post-doc (at Trockeneisbombe)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those blogs are worth following anyway. The next six months will be a challenge, as I attempt to juggle the remaining time in this postdoc with other commitments and the need to find ongoing employment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/06/25/doing-statistical-research/&#34;&gt;Roger Peng posted at Simply Statistics&lt;/a&gt; about what it is to &lt;a href=&#34;http://stattrak.amstat.org/2013/06/01/how-to-do-statistical-research/&#34;&gt;do statistical research&lt;/a&gt; and how research is essentially solving problems that can’t be solved with the current methods. The message I took from Peng’s post is that often you can 90% solve a problem with current methods and that a lot of the time this is “good enough” and you can come back to the problem later with some new approaches that go beyond the current methods. As part of the UPTECH project I’ve been doing a lot of work with Bayesian hierarchical linear models. While our data has been collected from a panel design (25 schools, two weeks at each) it’s not always appropriate to use a full-blown spatial model. For example, the microbiological work I’ve been doing with my Finnish collaborator is mostly solvable by using exchangeable means priors to estimate classroom level and school level effects. Recently I’ve also had to start looking at clustering techniques, meta-analysis, spatial modelling of high-resolution data, estimating personal exposure, large surveys, and many other applied science problems that require a novel statistical approach. This sort of collaboration/consulting work, according to Terry Speed (whose post Peng is discussing), is a chance to meet lots of people and work on some interesting problems. For me, it has involved learning about existing techniques and trying to figure out how my collaborators and I can apply them to our data to do the best inference we can. With the UPTECH work, there’s always going to be a large list of authors due to the size of the project and the number of people involved in collecting data. Authorship will always be an issue with our papers, both in terms of inclusion and ordering, and we’ve got a decent process in place which makes people aware of papers as they’re finishing up (but not yet ready for submission). My personal belief is that one should always be able to point to a published paper and say “I did that”. Collaboration in applied physics and chemistry seems to be a very different beast to collaboration in statistics and mathematics. Many of the postgraduate students I know in Mathematics have tended to write methods papers with their supervisor(s) and that’s it. There’s the occasional collaboration to apply the method to a problem, but unless you’re working on cross-disciplinary modelling work or a large project involving numerical simulation there doesn’t appear to be much scope for multi-author work. Look back at some of the foundational statistical papers and you’ll see they’ve been written by a single author (some (non-parametric) Bayesian foundations spring to mind: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.numdam.org/item?id=AIHP_1937__7_1_1_0&#34;&gt;de Finetti, 1937&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;amp;version=1.0&amp;amp;verb=Display&amp;amp;handle=euclid.pjm/1102992601&#34;&gt;Kingman, 1967&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&amp;amp;version=1.0&amp;amp;verb=Display&amp;amp;handle=euclid.aos/1176342360&#34;&gt;Ferguson, 1973&lt;/a&gt;). The question of when to collaborate, with whom, and what it will add is part and parcel of modern science but there are some fields where collaboration is rare and keeping the author list short &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/06/25/is-there-too-much-coauthorship-in-economics-and-science-more-generally-or-too-little/&#34;&gt;can lead to problems&lt;/a&gt;. Statistical research is necessary when there’s a problem to be solved that is 0% solvable with the current methods. Some of what I’m doing is novel, within the context of aerosol science, but I haven’t done as much stats research in my postdoc as in my PhD. This is no doubt a result of my doing as much collaboration as I am. I get to work on a lot of problems but there’s not much original statistical work in these papers; if I’m lucky I get to do some of the “10%” research. It’s hard to do statistical research in a physics group, especially as the only statistician here. I think if we had a second statistician in the group there’d be a lot more statistics being done both in terms of collaboration/consultation with the scientists and the methods we use to solve problems. The “Airports of the Future” project has quite a number of statisticians working on, among other things, Bayesian Networks, and they’re extending the BN methodology as well as applying it to a novel problem. Two of the members of this team gave a talk at BRAG this morning about visualisation of BN results. This is something I’ll no doubt need to learn about sooner or later as we plan on using BNs with another project that ILAQH is putting together. Four and a half years ago I was under the impression I was joining a physics group to do computational fluid dynamics. Since then I have been learning statistics almost constantly. It’s opened up many more opportunities for collaboration than CFD would have. The trick for me now is to try and put myself in a position where I’m working with other statisticians on statistics. We’ve got some work coming up soon with a more senior statistician at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ihbi.qut.edu.au/&#34;&gt;IHBI&lt;/a&gt;, which I hope will bring with it some opportunities for more statistical methodology work. Unrelated PS: The &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/06/26/dont-buy-bayesian-data-analysis/&#34;&gt;3rd edition of Gelman’s Bayesian Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt; is being released soon, with contributions from David Dunson and Aki Vehtari.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applying for jobs</title>
      <link>/./2013/06/14/applying-for-jobs/</link>

      <guid>/./2013/06/14/applying-for-jobs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just sent in my application for QUT’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hrd.qut.edu.au/jobs/ecard/&#34;&gt;ECARD&lt;/a&gt; (Early Career Academic Recruitment and Development) program. The program is an ongoing attempt by QUT to recruit young researchers and train them as lecturers and academics who will sustain the university as the more senior academics retire. It’s not just a staff hiring program, though, as it requires that those recruited into the program undertake a postgraduate course in tertiary education and engage themselves with the administrative aspects of the university as well. This round there are 11 positions in the Science and Engineering Faculty, two of which are with maths/stats. I’m hoping to get selected for one of these two positions. I’ve spent the last 4.5 years with an aerosol science research group learning how to be a statistician. It’s been a bit of a weird experience and reminds me of Professor Ian Turner (my Linear Algebra and Computational Mathematics lecturer) who has a PhD in Engineering yet does research into numerical algorithms for solving matrix systems and their mathematical properties. The prospect of moving back to the School of Mathematics doesn’t feel like I’d be going “home” so much as finding a new group of people to work with. I did my undergrad and honours in mathematics but my primary Honours supervisor has moved to the School of Public Health and most of my cohort have either moved on to other universities or gone into industry. The people, location, organisational structure, units, etc. have all changed since I left. Despite all these changes it’s still the QUT School of Mathematical Sciences and there are other Bayesian statisticians over there, something I can’t really say for the School of Chemistry, Physics and Mechanical Engineering (where I am now). Of course, I could remain employed in an applied sciences group and still collaborate with other statisticians (as I do now) but there’s a world of difference between my little office in M block with the other ILAQH members and a quarter of a floor full of mathematicians and statisticians in the new Science and Engineering Centre. For all my love of using Git and LaTeX to collaboratively write papers with people half a world away, you really can’t beat proximity to others like you to continually inspire and challenge you. There are a few other jobs that I’m looking at, both in Brisbane and overseas. I got some very good advice from a friend of mine who’s currently working in Northern Europe; you should aim to find a job that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has good people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is in a good place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is clearly the most important in terms of job satisfaction. Working on a project you don’t care about (but can competently do) sounds soul-destroying. Working with people you don’t get along with and who don’t value what you do will lead to stress, conflict, etc. and working in a place which has nothing going for it will prevent you from being able to enjoy your time away from work. I think an ECARD position within the School of Mathematical Sciences would fit the all three of these, particularly if I end up lecturing one of the new ST01 units and have some discretion over the sort of research I do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people make their visualisations in Excel, I make mine in R and others still use things like Processing or InDesign. Bret Victor &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/66085662&#34;&gt;shows us&lt;/a&gt; how the various ideas from each approach can be combined to make dynamic visualisations. It’s written with a view to &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/05/17/how-can-statisticians-help-psychologists-do-their-research-better/&#34;&gt;the interaction between statisticians and psychologists&lt;/a&gt; but it applies just as much to statisticians helping scientists with their statistics, which is basically my job at the moment. Two of my colleagues in BRAG gave &lt;a href=&#34;http://bragqut.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/geospatial-visualisation/&#34;&gt;a really neat talk&lt;/a&gt; about using R to visualise spatial data. Maybe &lt;a href=&#34;http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/07/charlemagnes-dna-and-our-universal-royalty/&#34;&gt;Europe’s genetic history&lt;/a&gt; isn’t as diverse as we’d previously thought. They’re not all Habsburgs but there’s a little bit of Charlemagne in all of us. I helped a colleague hand in her PhD thesis recently; perhaps she should have read this beforehand: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/05/22/how-not-to-hand-in-your-phd/&#34;&gt;How not to hand in your PhD&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve picked up a hobby over the last few months that is paying delicious dividends: homebrewing. It’s something I’d been wanting to try since about this time last year and I finally dropped the money (a cooking store voucher) on a cider homebrewing kit in February. My first batch was an apple cider that came with the kit and it’s been improving with age since the first bottle was opened in late February/early March. The second batch was a pear cider that a friend asked me to make for her; it was divided into two batches after primary fermentation so that I could try something different with the “excess”. The resulting pear and berry cider will make its debut quite soon, as it’s been patiently settling and aging over the last three weeks or so. While I haven’t been keeping time series of the specific gravity, temperature and colour of the cider as it brews, there is certainly grounds to do so. Brewing and statistics have a history which goes back at least as far as William Sealy Gosset, who developed the t-distribution (and test) under the name “Student” while working at the Guinness brewery in 1908. Brewing involves balancing complex ecosystems of a whole lot of different things (depending on what you’re making) and is essentially a giant biochemical experiment. To get properly into brewing requires an understanding of botany, chemistry, microbiology, physics and statistics as you attempt to turn your basic ingredients into something which is tasty, non-toxic and perhaps even effervescent. I would like to start brewing beer at home soon, which will no doubt lead to me reading a lot more about hops, malt, wort, grains and yeasts and taking more fastidious notes. So my exposure to microbiology has been twofold over the last year; working with a Finnish colleague on papers dealing with fungus and endotoxin counts in the UPTECH project and brewing my own alcoholic cider at home. The main fungus paper has been submitted and we’re checking the modelling on the endotoxin paper so that it can be submitted before this colleague leaves in the next few days. I can’t think of a more fitting thing to bring to her farewell party than a drinkable microbiology experiment. Bonus link: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1eghjq/op_delivers_wild_harvested_some_microbes_and_made/&#34;&gt;Homebrewing redditor who works in a microbiology lab discovers a new strain of fungus which produces the best beer he’s ever homebrewed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meta-analysis? Meta-regression?</title>
      <link>/./2013/05/14/meta-analysis-meta-regression/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis with a covariate feels really weird. I’m wanting to compare the relationship between the distributions of the mean concentration of endotoxin in the air and in dust samples across 50 locations. I wasn’t sure I did it the right way but the posterior estimates are consistent with my naïve approach of regressing the means of the air and dust samples. It’s important to account for the variability when doing this sort of &lt;em&gt;post hoc&lt;/em&gt; analysis because a point estimate of the mean doesn’t reflect anywhere near the full set of knowledge you have about your parameters of interest. On an unrelated note, another UPTECH paper has been &lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es400041r&#34;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;. This one’s looking at spatial variation of particle number concentration in the school environment. Congratulations to Farhad Salimi, the first author of this paper, on the publication of his first paper. Farhad’s one of the PhD students on the UPTECH project and is due to finish his thesis later this year. I’ve worked with him on two of his papers (this one and another which has been submitted) and he’s really thrown himself into learning how to use R. This has not only made it easier for me to collaborate with him but it’s also made his analysis possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Australia, at least, the impact factor of the journals you publish in plays a large role in your advance in academia. Universities are always under pressure to publish their research in more prestigious journals, conflating the impact factor of the journal and the impact of the research published in it. There are many ways journals can game their impact factor, many ways researchers can game the indices that describe the impact of their work, etc. That said, it’s always good to aim to produce research that will be accepted in a high quality journal. I’ve been excited about the PLoS journals since their launch and I believe QUT is a subscribing member, which means our publication fees are covered. It’s one of the best Open Access journal groups around and doesn’t appear to be a cash grab like some other publishers who are attempting to use Open Access as a business model to increase profits rather than because they believe in the free dissemination of research. UPTECH collected fungi and endotoxin data at the 25 schools, and we’re about to submit the fungi paper (which means work must continue on the endotoxin paper). I was considering whether we should submit to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/&#34;&gt;PLoS One&lt;/a&gt; (IF 2011: 4.092) and then had a look at what other journals they have which may be an appropriate home. I really think once we get the clinical data from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolcock.org.au/&#34;&gt;our Southern collaborators&lt;/a&gt; we should aim to do the best statistical modelling we can. I’m heartened by the fact that the head of the clinical group we’re working with has a strong background in stats and a desire to learn more Bayesian statistics. I don’t know if we can pull it off, but the prospect of having something investigating the role of fungi and endotoxin on child health published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plospathogens.org/&#34;&gt;PLoS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt; (IF 2011: 9.172) is exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are things I’ve heard of and never followed up like Expectation Maximisation (and Variational Bayes, for that matter), Expectation Propagation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Things I once learned about and forgot because I didn’t have the background at the time such as Importance Sampling, Rejection Sampling, Slice Sampling. Then there’s things that are the cutting edge of statistical research that aren’t necessarily statistical methods but means of implementing them and are transforming the way we do statistics, such as CUDA. I’ve managed to pick up a few little statistical novelties along the way such as nonparametric Bayes, hierarchical linear models and some of the theory behind GMRFs and Gaussian Processes but I feel like I’m lagging behind where I want to be. This could be a consequence of being based in a group with no other statisticians. Were I doing my postdoc in a statistics group I’d be more deeply immersed in a group with a culture of doing statistics research rather than doing scientific research which requires statistics I already know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How do you keep track of your group&#39;s papers?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UPTECH is probably the biggest and most collaborative project my research group has ever embarked upon. Bringing together aerosol researchers at ILAQH, clinical medical scientists at the Woolcock Institute for Medical Research and international collaborators, it is likely to generate about fifty papers in the coming years. We currently have no system for keeping track of who is working on what and how developed each paper is. It’s probably too big for one or two investigators to keep in their head and I don’t think a Word document or Excel spreadsheet is going to cut it. I spent some time this afternoon mucking around in Microsoft Access in an attempt to figure out how I could put a relational database together that’s built well enough to capture information about authorship, where the authors come from, which journal or conference the paper is being submitted to, etc. but still be simple enough that the people in my group, who are not database experts (and I’m certainly not one), can manage to operate it fairly painlessly such that they’ll actually use it. I had a play with the “Projects” template but it was a bit too much, even though it did have some nice features such as the ability to import contact details from Outlook. I ended up making a table for papers and a table for people and set up a form for data entry. The “people” table feeds a drop down selection for lead author and a drop down multiple selection field for co-authors, which was quite simple to set up and is going to make things much easier. It works for the time being and I’ve got a few things I’d like to add, such as queries to return which papers a person is working on, how many lead author papers each person has, etc. it’s going to be a much more interesting way to learn about Access and databases than maintaining the utterly massive UPTECH database that was designed by someone else and then passed to me. Although if there are purpose built systems for this sort of thing I am more than willing to listen to what others use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I work in an aerosol science group which has studied tobacco smoke. Something I can’t find in our publication history is a study on marijuana smoke. NORML have &lt;a href=&#34;http://norml.org/library/health-reports/item/norml-s-marijuana-health-mythology&#34;&gt;a page&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to disputing some of the myths surrounding marijuana that come from both the pro- and anti-marijuana camps. The review was done in 1994 so I’d be interested to see how the epidemiological evidence has changed as our equipment has improved. I don’t know that the Queensland government (or QUT) would let us purchase any marijuana to do the study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Are bullet points really the way to do this? Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m quite fortunate to work with two research groups headed by women. There’s no sexism coming from the top of these groups and there are roughly even numbers of men and women in each group. Still, I know that not every university, nor every group within my university, has this sort of balance. Whether overt or covert there are still institutional barriers to equality of opportunity for women. P.S. that EC video campaign is terrible&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It feels like it’s been a very long time since I posted a substantial update here. Last week was incredibly stressful and had me working on my thesis as well as on three other papers that I’m writing with colleagues here at ILAQH. My primary supervisor is back as of this week and it’s going to be a huge push to get this thesis finished, which means not much time for other projects. Since importing papers into my thesis document and expanding my literature review and introduction these past few days my thesis document has grown from about 50 to about 160 pages. Of course, the page and word count is unimportant in the end; what matters is that I write good work that is viewed favourably by the panel. I realised that I hadn’t announced it here but the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.car-cre.org.au/&#34;&gt;Centre for Air quality &amp;amp; health Research and evaluation (CAR)&lt;/a&gt; has granted me a post-doctoral fellowship worth 75% of a full time equivalent load. This is about twice what I get as an APA(I) scholarship holder, lasts for a year, and will keep me fed and clothed while I work on a variety of papers regarding statistical modelling of air quality.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub for Windows can be such a pain sometimes. I guess it’s partially my fault for attempting to use version control on the compiled PDF of a LaTeX document, but I spent a fair amount of time today attempting to fix up a colleague’s local repository. I’m now a bit more familiar with cherry-pick and rebase but it would have been nice to have it just work. For some reason, GitHub for Windows on this colleague’s computer simply &lt;em&gt;will not sync properly&lt;/em&gt;; my colleague has had to become a bit more familiar with the common commands (push, pull, fetch, commit, merge). It works fine on their Mac, though. I run GitHub for OS X at home and it’s an absolute dream. At work (Windows XP) I have had no end of trouble with various programs like TortoiseGit. I think when I start my post-doc I’ll organise to have my computer converted to a Linux system. After all that, though, we did make some pretty good progress on the modelling in this paper. I’m not quite sure which journal we’ll be sending it to but it’s a really nice piece of work with some personal monitoring data, simple but informative analysis and some very creative use of the base graphics system in R.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For someone who’s meant to be finishing his PhD I sure do have a lot of other peoples’ papers on my plate. Today and Friday I had a chat with another PhD student from the UPTECH project about looking for spatial variation within the UPTECH schools. We’ve got some divergent ideas about how to go about it but we sat down this afternoon and spent some time going over regression modelling versus exploratory/summary statistics and how we can move from using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to doing non-parametric function estimation. I wrote some code and commented it as we went, so it should be fairly straightforward to write the accompanying methodology subsection for the paper. I’m going to spend the week focussing on my final thesis paper (a spatio-temporal model for data from a split panel design). I got some comments back from my supervisors last week and there’s a lot to be done checking certain sources of variation. I spent a fair bit of time today looking over a former students’ papers, checking old email threads, discussing a few things with the co-authors of his papers who are still around and have even been tracking down which particular instruments were used to perform the measurements. It’ll be important to check that my spatial analysis of the within-school variation matches up with the other UPTECH student’s analysis. If we come to opposite conclusions then at least one of us is wrong. I’m now tossing up whether I should check my results from the supercomputer or wait until tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turning tables into graphs</title>
      <link>/./2012/10/30/turning-tables-into-graphs/</link>

      <guid>/./2012/10/30/turning-tables-into-graphs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’ve noticed from working with scientists (of various background) is that they love tables full of means and standard deviations as a way of summarising the variability in some data or regression parameters. &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2012/10/communication-is-a-central-task-of-statistics-and-ideally-a-state-of-the-art-data-analysis-can-have-state-of-the-art-displays-to-match/&#34;&gt;Andrew Gelman’s latest discussion of a paper&lt;/a&gt; makes the point that tables of numbers are awful and that a well made graphic does a good job of conveying the uncertainty. He refers in his comment to a paper he wrote, “Let’s Practice What We Preach: Turning Tables into Graphs” [1], which shows how graphs can be better at summarising variability, often in less space than a table. Another thing I really like about the paper is that it endorses the use of R/S/S+ for plotting and faults Excel for not offering enough control to the user (and it makes ugly graphs anyway). I’m a big fan of using graphs because numbers don’t really mean that much to me, especially when dealing with things like splines and random walk models for non-linear function estimation. The UPTECH papers I’m writing on the fungal data and nanotracer measurements have a lot of graphs where previously there were tables or Excel plots which weren’t as easy to interpret. I’ve been spending quite a bit of time on them so that we can present to our readers, for example, just how different the means are in our hierarchical Bayesian model. I think tables have a place and I use them in my own papers. I’m using a table in a spatial modelling paper to describe the prevailing winds and local geography at each of 13 measurement locations. There’s a map of the locations so that I don’t have to put things like “location” in the table. A list of features doesn’t translate as well to a plot as spatial locations do. I don’t think it’s appropriate to list row upon row of means, standard deviations, quantiles, etc. Long/wide tables of model fit criteria such as MSE, AIC, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc. are incredibly boring and do not scale well when you’re comparing more than, say, three models. I think I might try to send this paper around my group as an attempt to convince them to abandon tables in favour of concise graphs. With the uptake of R among some of the more senior researchers/staff looking promising, I think it’s a message that might actually get some traction. [1] Gelman, Andrew, Pasarica, C., and Dodhia, R. (2002). Let’s practice what we preach: turning tables into graphs. American Statistician 56, 121-130.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been out for an after work drink with some people from ILAQH. Rather than going to bed after getting home I decided that what I &lt;em&gt;urgently&lt;/em&gt; need to do is write about the exchangeability in this hierarchical prior for the microbiology paper I’m writing with Heidi Salonen. I got a bit carried away and have reformulated the model a bit to properly represent the hierarchy while still making the code as similar in its working across all branches. Now I’ve got a bit carried away and am looking at how best to visually represent an estimate of the difference between indoor and outdoor fungal counts. It’s nice that I can generate these estimates from MCMC output rather than having to do formal testing that assumes a particular distribution. I’m looking forward to presenting these plots and results to my co-authors because it really shows the power of Bayesian hierarchical modelling as a tool for examining random effects across groups where there is little data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ANOVA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANOVA is one of those things that all the scientists in my group do when writing a paper where there’s more than one group, which is totally natural and a good first step for data analysis. Whether it’s looking at the mean concentration of some aerosol at the UPTECH schools, the level of diesel engine emissions by fuel type or some other experimental setup, ANOVA will typically make it into a paper (even if only as a &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; test). ANOVA (or a &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; test) may not always be an appropriate test to use, e.g. if the data is not normal, has a few large outliers or exhibits some sort of reliance on a covariate. In such cases it may be better to use a regression model with a non-Gaussian likelihood. This week I’ve spent a bit of time getting to grips with the Mann-Whitney U test as a way of testing medians, another summary which is used for aerosol concentrations. It’s not featured in Excel, so the person I was helping had to dust off their SPSS skills and we eventually made our way through and figured out how to run the test. But descriptive statistics of quantiles or measures of central tendency aren’t nearly as exciting as something I’ve come across, functional ANOVA. I met Cari Kaufman at ISBA earlier this year and we had a bit of a chat about spatio-temporal models of climate data with Gaussian processes and Gaussian Markov Random Fields. When I got back to Brisbane I decided to have a look at what she’s written and whether I should think about applying to work with her at Berkeley. Kaufman has &lt;a href=&#34;http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2010/vol05/issue01/kaufman.pdf&#34;&gt;a 2010 paper&lt;/a&gt; [1], which appears to have its genesis &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2007/10/anova/&#34;&gt;at least as far back as 2007&lt;/a&gt;, where functional ANOVA is discussed as a way of testing whether some observed effect (which may be a nonlinear function) is the same across groups. The examples given include temperature records in Canada and spatio-temporal modelling of regional climate in the UK. I would like to go over the functional ANOVA paper with the QUT NP Bayes reading group, as it’s a very interesting use of the Gaussian process prior. I’d also like to use it in my own work, as the question “Is the daily trend the same at each school?” is of interest to me. [1] Cari G. Kaufman and Stephan R. Sain, “Bayesian Functional ANOVA Modeling Using Gaussian Process Prior Distributions”, &lt;em&gt;Bayesian Analysis&lt;/em&gt; 5, 2010, pages 123-150.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a comment earlier today that seemed like a bit of a throwaway at the time but I think it’s well worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I leave here next year, everyone in this group will be using R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few people in my group have been really quick to start using it for their analysis and their work is much improved because of it. A handful of others have been a bit reluctant to get started but admit to wanting to learn how and have started to pick up some short guides, books, etc. and ask me for help from time to time. The other members of the group can see that it’s useful but are probably reluctant to invest the time to learn and make do with Excel for the time being. The goal is to get the reluctant people confident with playing around and making mistakes, asking the more gung-ho members for help, while I teach a few basic concepts in a small group environment to those who are completely unfamiliar with R. I think it’s doable. There are plenty of ways to use R for analysis and visualisation, whether it’s via command line on QUT’s supercomputer, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://rstudio.org/download/desktop&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/&#34;&gt;R Commander&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/&#34;&gt;Revolution Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://rforge.net/JGR/&#34;&gt;JGR&lt;/a&gt;, or some other variant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking at microbes with BUGS</title>

      <guid>/./2012/10/15/looking-at-microbes-with-bugs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a paper with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uku.fi/hallinto/viestinta/alumni/alumnijuttu3.shtml&#34;&gt;Heidi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/heidi-salonen/20/1b5/677&#34;&gt;Salonen&lt;/a&gt;, a Finnish microbiologist who’s been with us for quite some time and is working on the microbiological (e.g. fungi, bacteria) aspects of the UPTECH project. Due to the timeframes of our presence at each school and the amount of time it takes to measure microbiological activity, we only have a handful of measurements at each school. This represents a perfect opportunity to do some very simple Bayesian hierarchical modelling in order to estimate a distribution of possible microbe concentrations at each school. It’s not a particularly taxing task (it’s more or less the kind of thing that you might find in Gelman’s textbook) but it’s still a nice example of how you can use Bayesian modelling to estimate the mean of a bunch of schools by assuming that the mean and standard deviation at each school are themselves drawn from a distribution of means and standard deviations. I’ve done the modelling, sure, but the next step is to explain it to Heidi and the other co-authors in such a way that they feel comfortable putting something in the paper that’s a little beyond taking the mean of the data and standard deviation of the data as summaries for the microbial concentrations at each school. So it was nice to dust off the old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbugs.info/w/&#34;&gt;OpenBUGS&lt;/a&gt; and write out a simple model with prediction within each school based on the repeated sampling available to us. We hope to use this simple model as the basis of a model which includes covariates and perhaps a bit more random effects modelling. So I don’t have to keep manually copying and pasting data from Excel files I’ll be looking at getting back into using &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html&#34;&gt;rjags&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2jags/index.html&#34;&gt;r2jags&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BRugs/index.html&#34;&gt;BRugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2WinBUGS/index.html&#34;&gt;R2WinBUGS&lt;/a&gt;. One of my colleagues in BRAG thinks I should just write my own sampler in MATLAB for this as it’ll be faster, but with so few observations (6-15 at each of 25 schools) speed’s not a huge issue here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/luke-knibbs/40/596/488&#34;&gt;Luke Knibbs&lt;/a&gt; started not long into my PhD as a postdoc at ILAQH, working with our group on a few projects such as commuter exposure to traffic emissions and emissions from vacuum cleaners. Luke did his PhD at Macquarie and has now moved on to the UQ School of Medicine where he’s got an academic post. We bade farewell to Luke on Friday afternoon with nibblies and drinks in the Botanic Gardens and he was given an indoor plant he’d been considering buying as a farewell gift. Apparently the plant species is good at removing VOCs frmo the air. As a result of the impending completion of my PhD and the fact that my post-doctoral work will be working on stats with everyone else in the group, I’ve been shifted from the repurposed lab to Luke’s desk. So I’ve gone from sharing a 45m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; space with seven other people to a 12m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; space with one other person. It’s much quieter here and a few days a week I’ll have the room to myself. It’s closer to the more senior members of the group than my old room but has the downside of not having any windows except for the one at the top of the room which does let some natural light in via Zoran Ristovski’s office. &lt;a href=&#34;newdigs.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/newdigs.jpg&#34; title=&#34;My new digs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been three and a half years since I started my PhD program and the UPTECH measurement campaign finished a matter of weeks ago. So I’m a little late to the game but last week was my first field trip campaign. Rohan Jayaratne had been trying to organise this trip over the last two weeks, waiting for a time where the wind would be blowing in the right direction, checking the wind forecasts every day for a while. On Tuesday we finally headed out to do the measurements with another PhD student, Megat Azman Megat Mokhtar. We’d had talks about what sort of questions we’d be attempting to answer and how we could ensure we collected data that would allow us to answer them. What started out as a fifteen minute chat about equipment turned into a long discussion about semi-parametric regression and how interactions of non-linear effects can be fit. What was going to originally be just a publication of some observational results is probably going to end up with some generalised additive models attempting to model the interactions we expect to see. Rohan, Megat and I packed up the car at about 8:30 and drove out to the Gateway Motorway to do some roadside measurements. We took some &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aerasense.com/&#34;&gt;Nanotracers&lt;/a&gt; and a CPC and spent the day taking continous measurements. The Nanotracers are very new and we’ve been using them with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au/Misc/UPTECH%20Study%20Design%2029%20July%202011.pdf&#34;&gt;UPTECH&lt;/a&gt; to measure child exposure to ultrafine particles. It was interesting to see the setup of the equipment and gave me a greater appreciation for just how much work everyone put in to the UPTECH study. [caption id=“attachment_478” align=“aligncenter” width=“225”][&lt;img src=&#34;p9120053.jpg?w=225&#34; title=&#34;Sam wearing nanotracers&#34; /&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/p9120053.jpg&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/p9120053.jpg&lt;/a&gt;) The Philips Aerasense Nanotracer: fastest personal sampler in the West[/caption] Megat brought two walkie-talkies with him for us to use to communicate when one of us was away from where we’d set up. To relieve the (my?) boredom in some parts, I treated Megat and Rohan to a rendition of Toto’s “Africa” and Four Non Blondes’ “What’s Up?” (often called “What’s going on?”). The weather was very pleasant, the wind more or less exactly what we wanted and we managed to get about six hours of measurements before heading home. We’re now at the stage of having the data cleaned (checking for errors in the measurements) and doing some exploratory data analysis. In the coming weeks, provided I’ve got time for it, we’ll be looking at our modelling. I hope to put a preprint up when we’ve submitted it. It’s going to be a very interesting piece of modelling and Rohan sees it as an update to a paper our group has previously written but with better analysis and a more novel data collection technique. I’m excited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this morning with Tenzin, one of our PhD students, and Xuan Ling, a team member of ours who leaves us today, discussing the use of Access for Tenzin’s project. The last time I really paid much attention to databases was in 2000/2001 when my senior IPT class was learning about them. I learned SQL with MicroSQL (which I can’t find a reference to on Google) and while we did use Access to build a simple database it was only through the form and query point and click interface. So this morning’s meeting was me scribbling out database design a la Visio Modeller (before Microsoft bought it) to try and work out what sort of tables would be needed and then trying to figure out how on earth to build said tables. Tenzin’s way ahead of me here with the database from his pilot questionnaire and he’s got some very cool subdatasheet stuff going on. If I knew how Access works it would have been a much more productive meeting this morning but it was still good to try to figure it out together. I’ve had more success with getting R to talk to our big UPTECH database through ODBC. It’s the first time I’ve done anything like it and I’m managing, with some success, to get stuff into R. There are a few bizarre design choices in the database so it’s not as straightforward as it could be, but I can copy the text from the Access queries and get what I need. I’d much rather grab a chunk of data and process it in R than open Access, run some queries to get the data I want, save it as an Excel file, convert it to CSV and then load it into R.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any experience with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.monperrus.net/martin/bibtexbrowser&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? The list of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au/Misc/Publicat.htm&#34;&gt;ILAQH publications&lt;/a&gt; is a bit of a mess and I’d like to use it for my own page as well. I suspect ILAQH might need a new website. I notice there’s a &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-publications/&#34;&gt;Wordpress plugin&lt;/a&gt; for it as well, which is nice. Edit: Two relevant links: &lt;a href=&#34;http://wpmu.org/wordpress-com-vs-self-hosted-wordpress-what-you-need-to-know/&#34;&gt;WordPress.com vs. Self-Hosted WordPress - What You Need To Know&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/convert-hosted-wordpress-blog-selfhosted-35266.html&#34;&gt;How to Convert a Hosted WordPress Blog to Self-Hosted&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect I’ll need to convert to a self-hosted installation to install bibtexbrowser, or at least fork out some money with Wordpress for the ability to install plugins (is that an option?) Edit 2: I might also have to drop $8.95/month on hosting (and $3.85/month for a unique IP) to set up Wordpress but at least my host/domain company offers it with a one click install.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had a 45 minute chat with two of the PhD students in my group about statistics. I had made some comments at one of their talks at Healthy Buildings about the summary statistics they were using for a ratio of indoor and outdoor particle concentrations and they wanted to catch up to discuss that and my first paper on using GAMs for temporal trends and meteorology. I think I’ve managed to convince both of them that using R is a good idea and that using spline models will help look at non-linear effects. They’re going to read some of the references that I listed. We also had a chat about how ANOVA’s a good start for data analysis and I suggested that they read Gelman’s paper (recently referred to in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/2012/07/12/plenary-speech/&#34; title=&#34;Plenary speech&#34;&gt;plenary speech&lt;/a&gt;). I think the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openair/index.html&#34;&gt;openair&lt;/a&gt; package is something they might look at given one of the other students in their room uses it. Openair uses mgcv to do some of its non-parametric estimation. I’m also starting a paper with one of our postdocs looking at personal exposure to ultrafine particles. We’ve got some very interesting data from quite a new instrument and the way the experiment was designed we are going to be able to answer some very interesting questions. The colleague who will probably be the primary author has to move back overseas for at least a few months so we’ll be collaborating from across an ocean or two. Our meetings recently have involved having an instance of R open to look at some data and a LaTeX document for writing down what we decide. Our postdoc asked me to email them the file but instead we sat down and set up a GitHub account and I showed that it wasn’t particularly hard to operate git in terms of basic functionality. They’ve used MATLAB before and have been getting used to using R, so this shouldn’t be too hard for them. So it’s nice to see a few little changes here and there not just in terms of how we approach a problem but with the tools we use to make our jobs easier and to improve the quality of our output.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where to start if you&#39;re going to revise statistics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’d like to think it was my plenary speech that has spurred this, but given that they didn’t see it I’m not sure that it was, but one of the academics in my lab has decided it’s time to refresh their statistical knowledge. I think this is great, because they got their PhD a long time ago and have probably been using the same statistical methods for at least the last ten years. The book they’ve decided to use is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Statistics-Murray-Spiegel/dp/0070602816&#34;&gt;Schaum’s Outline of Statistics&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve used books from this range before to revise linear algebra, differential equations, etc. and have even taught small courses (privately) based on the topics they cover and in the order they cover them. A flick through the book confirmed that it was full of frequentist testing and other similar statistical methods that I spent my talk saying were a good start but not the end of the analysis when writing a scientific paper. The book’s online summary says it covers the use of MINITAB. I’m glad to see that it discusses the use of software other than Excel to perform analysis but I recommend people use books in Springer’s “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles&#34;&gt;Use R!&lt;/a&gt;” range because R is free (in terms of both speech and beer) and is much more flexible than MINITAB in terms of programming it and running different types of analysis. Where MINITAB is based on a point and click GUI, making it great for a first year statistics class where students may not be familiar with programming, R is driven by the command line and is more easily scripted. Learning to use R means giving yourself the opportunity to use the many &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html&#34;&gt;packages&lt;/a&gt; that extend its functionality. The books I’ve used in the Use R! range include &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springer.com/statistics/computational+statistics/book/978-0-387-93836-3&#34;&gt;A Beginner’s Guide to R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springer.com/statistics/statistical+theory+and+methods/book/978-0-387-92297-3&#34;&gt;Bayesian Computation with R&lt;/a&gt;. While I’d definitely recommend these Use R! books, as they’re aimed at people wanting to use R to do better analysis, there are a few others that I’ve found incredibly useful. It’s important for me to point out that my background differs from my colleague’s so they may not find the books as relevant or accessible. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/&#34;&gt;Gelman et. al - Bayesian Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Around my stats group, this book is called “The Bible”. It’s probably the best textbook I’ve come across. It’s full of information, tutorials, detailed descriptions of the theory and methods and how they can be applied. This is certainly a graduate level statistics textbook, though, and it assumes calculus at what I’d say is probably a second year mathematics degree level. You may find this book difficult if you don’t feel comfortable with multiplying integrals together (which is really what Bayesian analysis is). I sent my colleague a link to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/AOS259.pdf&#34;&gt;Gelman’s Annals of Applied Statistics article on ANOVA&lt;/a&gt;. Might as well plug &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/&#34;&gt;Gelman’s blog&lt;/a&gt; while I’m talking about him. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Biostatistics-Bayesian-Introduction-Probability-Statistics/dp/0471468428&#34;&gt;Woodworth - Biostatistics: a Bayesian introduction&lt;/a&gt;. I found this very useful in giving a more applied approach to introductory Bayesian statistics. There’s a good review of the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theannals.com/content/39/7/1376.2.full&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I agree with the reviewers about the importance of the preface in that it talks about the philosophy of statistics in science and discusses the differences between frequentist and Bayesian statistics. The book walks the reader through a lot of the topics which frequentist statistics deals with but in a Bayesian setting. I find this sort of comparison very useful (and appreciate when Mike Jordan says that a lot of machine learning techniques are just Bayesian statistics with a different name) as most people who have taken a statistics class will have seen linear modelling, ANOVA and a little about statistical design. The book also introduces the use of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openbugs.info/w/&#34;&gt;WinBUGS&lt;/a&gt; as a tool for Bayesian modelling. As an aside, I attended an introductory course run by my supervisor, Kerrie Mengersen, where she was teaching us how to use R to write a Gibbs sampler for a very simple problem and how to do it in WinBUGS as well. One of the other attendees, the leader of a medical science research group, had it in their head that they would use Excel to write the Gibbs sampler because it provides nice reports (summary stats, plots, etc.) through a plugin they had. Comparing the time it took WinBUGS and R to run the code against the Excel’s run time was probably what convinced me that Excel was one of the worst pieces of software that one could use for statistics. Great for spreadsheets, awful for statistics. A non-technical book which does a good job extending the philosophical discussion to the history of Bayesian statistics and its use in solving some very complex problems is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Theory-That-Would-Not-Die/dp/1452636850&#34;&gt;Sharon Bertsch McGrayne’s The Theory That Would Not Die&lt;/a&gt; (which I like to think of as the “A Brief History of Time” of Bayesian statistics). It’s very readable and really drives home the importance of Bayesian statistics and the profundity of Bayes and Laplace in developing this approach. I really don’t think there’s much use revising the basics of frequentism as I disagree with its interpretation of probability and find the idea of confidence intervals problematic. Hypothesis testing is also another problem that I have with frequentism and I think we’re going to see a lot of scientific papers in the near future converting the p values for their ANOVA into a “sigma” level as a result of CERN’s announcement of the 5 sigma certainty of their search for a new boson. Tony O’Hagan has &lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesian.org/forums/news/3648&#34;&gt;a good post&lt;/a&gt; about the “sigma” issue on the ISBA forums. Edited to add: TL;DR? Got a maths degree and some familiarity with stats? Read Gelman. Don’t have a maths degree? Read Woodworth. Want to understand what Bayesian stats is but don’t want to read a textbook? Read McGrayne. Want to know how to use R? Read a Use R! book. Once you’ve got a decent understanding of what statistics is, read papers for specific topics because there is almost never a book about what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I gave a speech as part of the plenary session “Standing on the shoulders of giants”. I was joined on stage by Mengyan Gong from Tsinghua University and Joana Madureira from the University of Porto and the three of us were to talk about our position as students within the field of air quality and how we see ourselves contributing. After the three of us gave our ten minute talks, Professor &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=21633181&#34;&gt;Charles Weschler&lt;/a&gt; gave a talk about what we currently know about biochemistry and microbiology &lt;em&gt;vis a vis&lt;/em&gt; the role of chemicals and microbes in indoor air and health. I think it was a great session and I’d like to thank Lidia Morawska for coming up with the idea and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.bus.qut.edu.au/sefdean/&#34;&gt;Martin Betts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/Nazaroff?destination=people%2Ffaculty%2FNazaroff&#34;&gt;William Nazaroff&lt;/a&gt; for chairing the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke about the need for better statistics in science and how it was up to supervisors to encourage their students to look at novel approaches for data analysis and for students to be curious, creative and willing to learn in order to ensure that the field does not grow stagnant. I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/hbplen.pdf&#34;&gt;uploaded the slides&lt;/a&gt; (which are quite spare) and a transcript of what I planned to say is available below (perhaps I should try to get this published in Indoor Air as a letter). I did vary from the script in a few parts and I will post the video online when it’s available. I will try to include links in the transcript to references so people can find out about these techniques that I get so excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Quantitative questions, quality answers”&lt;/strong&gt; A talk for the “Standing on the shoulders of giants” session&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I, as a student, am to further the field of indoor air and built environmental health it will be by standing on the shoulders of giants. The scientists, engineers and others who have gone before me in this field have developed a rich body of ideas and questions that have gone unanswered as a result of there being other work that they must do. But as one moves up the academic ladder, writing grant applications and supervising postgraduate students the chance to investigate some of these questions in depth arises. A team of PhD students with a diverse skill set can be assembled to assist the other academics in the team and to help drive the research output of the group. This has happened with my group’s UPTECH project, which is the topic of a session later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Graham Farquhar of the Australian National University, Canberra, one of Australia’s most cited academics, the key to producing high quality science is to start with a really good hypothesis driven question that no one has answered and answer it. That seems fairly straight forward? In the case of UPTECH, the unanswered question is “What is the effect of exposure to airborne nano and ultrafine particles emitted from motor vehicles on the health of children in schools?”. Data collected in this project include two weeks of indoor and out aerosol and meteorology measurements at each of 25 primary schools. Indoor microbiology measurements are taken in one or two classrooms at each school and health diagnostic tests are performed on the students in these classes, accompanied by a take home survey which includes questions about family health history, demographics and housing characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project generates a huge amount of data that has the potential to reveal some very interesting relationships. But to do so requires statistics beyond ANOVA and linear regression. The same can really be said of any modern scientific project. Don’t get me wrong, ANOVA is a great tool for exploratory data analysis [1] and testing whether a term in a regression model is zero or not. But to stop the analysis at descriptive statistics and testing for equal means across groups is to cheat yourself out of the opportunity to examine why these differences arise and really get to know what your data is telling you. ANOVA can be replaced with a Generalised Linear Model with factor terms. Any measured covariates can then be included in this GLM rather than just calculating the correlation between the covariate and the response. If the effect is suspected to be non-linear there are a range of regression models which are commonly used in the statistical and computer sciences but have not found their way into the natural sciences and I will talk about these soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of new statistical techniques and the ubiquity of computers in the workplace means that there is really no excuse for using statistical techniques that were developed for agricultural field trials are limited in their ability to explain variation in a data set. Expecting senior academics and industry practitioners to maintain statistical education throughout their careers is a bit of a tall ask in some cases. There’s so much work to be done keeping up with the science that the statistics often falls by the wayside. In my mind, the role of the supervisor is to present a problem and then direct the creativity and curiosity of the student. The role of the student is to answer the research question in a paper which weaves together the experience of the supervisor with high quality research and statistical modelling appropriate to the data and hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s much more to data analysis than doing ANOVA. If you suspect that there might be homogenous groups within a set of observations, why not try a clustering algorithm like k-means [2] or a finite mixture model? [3] Don’t know how many groups there are? Try an infinite mixture model [4]. Think that certain covariates might have a different effect within those groups? A Dirichlet Process Mixture of GLMs is an option [5]. The Indian Buffet Process will help you identify common patterns across a bunch of correlated covariates and reduce the dimension of your data [6]. If you suspect the effect of humidity on particle number concentration is non-linear but aren’t sure about what it’s going to look like you could try a spline model [7,8]. For a smooth spatial relationship across a network of monitors you can use a Gaussian predictive process with a Matern class covariance function [9] or go all out and use a Gaussian process with non-parametric covariance [10]. Want to combine the effect sizes from some previous studies of the same thing to estimate an overall effect? Use Bayesian meta-analysis rather than a weighted average [11].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all common approaches in the statistical community and I have seen them applied to scientific problems, many related to air quality or health. These techniques are much newer than ANOVA and their development in statistics and computer science means that professional scientists may not ever be exposed to them. So it’s up to students to be aware of new techniques which are applicable to their research. But is it too much to expect that all students are well versed in such a range of statistical techniques? Probably. Especially when you consider that a lot of these things aren’t taught in undergraduate science degrees. Science graduates are the obvious choice when recruiting science PhD students or industry practitioners. But science and engineering is strengthened by solid statistics. And the statistics are solid when a group’s capacity for statistics is solid, whether by employing one directly, choosing candidates with a strong statistical education, building links with a statistics research group at a university or providing for the ongoing statistical training of early career researchers and/or students. Our science must not just demonstrate that something is happening but attempt to understand why that effect occurs. We must quantify it and how and why it varies. Highly influential work, such as the work presented by our keynote speakers, arises when appropriate statistics raises high quality experimental science to where it belongs. The reader has before them a clear picture of what is happening and why. I see my role in my group, and through it, my role in our broad field, as fostering statistical creativity and curiosity. I am there to help provide tools which the people around me can use to solve these unanswered problems. Encouraging people to step outside the “ANOVA and linear regression in Excel” frame of mind has motivated them to ask questions about how best to fit some data which shows a non-linear effect, how to write code to process output from our instruments that will calculate summary statistics and generate plots, how to look at trends in time series data, and so on. In return, I’ve been given the opportunity to work on some really interesting air quality problems with some people who really know their science. So I pick up some more knowledge about aerosols and health, they get exposed to new ways of analysing data, and we get to present our interesting results to the world with robust and novel analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Healthy Buildings</title>
      <link>/./2012/07/09/healthy-buildings/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am taking a break from the final session of the day to catch up on some thesis related emails. Figured I might as well write up what’s happened so far. The welcome reception at GoMA last night was quite good. Dr Bruce Flegg, Minister for Housing and Public Works, gave a good speech welcoming us all and stressing the importance of what we do. I was very impressed with how across the topic Flegg seemed to be. Dr Flegg has a background as a GP and is all too aware of the problems associated with unhealthy workplaces with things like mesothelioma and asbestosis. He has seen people who have developed health issues associated with accidental environmental exposure (so not people installing these materials like Bernie Banton). Flegg also spoke about the need to ensure that public housing stock, particularly in our indigenous communities, are of a high quality in terms of their energy efficiency but also in the way they promote health and are appropriate to the communities and regions in which they’re built. At the opening I also got to chat with Susan Savage, the Assistant Dean of Teaching and Learning in the new Science and Engineering Faculty at QUT. We discussed changes to the first year Bachelor of Science program that sound very promising. A common first semester will expose students to what science is and how it is done before students choose a major in their second semester. Mathematics will be embedded in each subject to make sure that our students continue to be exposed to it rather than doing a single Data Analysis unit and then thinking that they’ll never have to do statistics again. The opening plenary symposium, “Balance of Power”, was a discussion by two international speakers about the issue of a compromise between energy efficient buildings and healthy buildings. Professor Jiang Yi from Tsinghua University spoke about the issues of growing energy demand in the search for thermal comfort and presented some very interesting case studies where Chinese buildings have been built to maximise the availability of natural ventilation and light while still providing a very high quality of thermal comfort for the occupants. His message was that a combination of decentralised air conditioning systems that don’t work against each other can augment a default system of natural ventilation (with office windows which can be opened, for a start) to drastically cut our energy usage and ensure a ready supply of fresh air. The second speaker, Philippa Howden-Chapman discussed the problems faced in the New Zealand housing stock. New Zealand is a first world country but most of the public housing stock was built around World War II, prior to the first global oil shock, and is characterised by poor insulation and unflued gas heaters (often LPG). As a result, people in public housing are facing the choice of “heat or eat”. And even if they can manage to heat themselves, NO2 levels in the home tend to be three times higher than in homes without an LPG heater. Her group has done a lot of work to intervene in the worst affected homes and improve thermal comfort, health and energy efficiency. New Zealand has the lowest per capita energy use in the OECD despite being so damn cold. But heating an uninsulated house can be very expensive. The big finding is that if the government spends the money retrofitting homes they save a lot in terms of public pharmaceutical provision, hospital visits and lost productivity and education. An econometric analysis showed a 3.9:1 return on investment, with the investment in a house paying for itself if a single hospital visit in that house can be avoided. I spent the parallel sessions this morning doing AV support for two sessions. The venue has done a great job making it as easy as possible for presenters so the most I had to do was look for two missing speakers and walk people through how to use the pointer. The first session I attended was all about ventilation and there were some very interesting presentations about filtering incoming air and how being a bit clever about our behaviour in the home can lead to much better air quality. The second session focussed on regional solutions and included three talks about stoves in the developing world. A lot of poorer regions such as rural Kenya and Andean Peru rely on the use of solid fuels such as dung and the homes typically do not have very good ventilation. Some new stove designs were developed with community feedback in order to arrive at a design which was both energy efficient and didn’t depart from the cultural aesthetic of the typical oven design. Other considerations included the cost to the end user, provision of local jobs in assembling and maintaining the ovens and ensuring that the indoor air quality was improved beyond the energy efficiency gains. One of the more novel approaches for this was to use a thermoelectric device that could power an air blower with waste heat from the oven. This meant that particulate matter and incomplete combustion byproducts (CO mainly) were removed much quicker. Excess energy from these thermoelectric devices can be used to charge mobile phones (and something like 40% of homes in rural Kenya have mobile phones!). Some very inspiring work, showing that science can have a real impact in the developing world. I’ve also caught up with the two other students in my plenary session, Joana and Mengyan. The three of us will be meeting with our session chairs on Thursday morning (QUT SEF Dean Martin Betts and UC Berkeley Professor William Nazaroff) to discuss the session but today’s chat was a bit of getting to know each other and discussing what Brisbane’s like. Joana was very interested in what sort of Australian foods she could take back to Portugal for her friends. Vegemite, Tim Tams and Iced Vovos. The conference is going well overall. The QUT Events team and the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre staff have done an amazing job making sure everything’s as clear as possible. It’s a great venue (the new wing of the BCEC) and the conference is bringing together people from 40 countries, be they academics, students, consultants, industry practitioners or vendors. There are 160ish students in attendance (many of whom I’ll meet tomorrow night at the student event) and I’ve heard that something like three quarters of attendees are from overseas. I’m looking forward to the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two weeks I’ve sent two papers to Annals of Applied Statistics and uploaded them to the arXiv. This fulfills the minimum publication requirements for a PhD by publication at QUT. So it’s a milestone on the way to completion. Now I just have to sort out a fourth paper as backup, give two presentations at next week’s conference, organise a final seminar session, compile all my work into a thesis and get it to my supervisors. On top of my immediate thesis work on spatio-temporal modelling, I’ve got a paper for Healthy Buildings on methods for analysing the UPTECH survey data that’ll get published, a paper on which I’m coauthor (particle losses in a thermodenuder system) that’s almost finished and the microbiology paper I wrote about previously. Busy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Finnish paper is pretty much ready for submission to Annals of Applied Stats. I’ve updated my publications page to include a link to the preprint on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0558&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;. I will update my CV soon and I’ll add my posters and slides to the publications page. The Higgs boson - what’s the deal with that? &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/156221787/cern-discovers-a-new-particle-likely-the-higgs-boson&#34;&gt;NPR has a good article on it&lt;/a&gt;. I spent the evening watching the Higgs announcements at uni and even though I thought the CERN slides were pretty cluttered and didn’t like the layout, nothing had prepared me for the ATLAS slides. Bad colour schemes (if you can call them that) and Comic Sans MS? Yuk. You don’t make science accessible by making people think “Hey. That looks like &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; could have designed that. Scientists aren’t so different to me after all!” Some clearly presented slides that weren’t stuffed full of text and images are, in my opinion, the key to a good scientific presentation. 1 slide per minute, no more than 5-6 lines with no more than 5-6 words per line. The slides should touch on the key points so people can, at a glance, get a good idea of what’s going on. The talk that accompanies the slides is what conveys the rest of the information in more natural language. There was a lot of great science presented tonight, but it wasn’t presented well. David Spiegelhalter &lt;a href=&#34;http://understandinguncertainty.org/higgs-it-one-sided-or-two-sided&#34;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; the five sigma significance of the ATLAS/CERN results. P-values and confidence intervals are two things where I think frequentist probability stops being conceptually simpler than Bayesian statistics and becomes about questions like “What is the probability of observing the data I have seen given that I have this model and these parameter estimates?” and “If I did an infinite number of trials how many times would I expect this interval for my sample mean to cover the true mean?” and “Something something agriculture”. &lt;a href=&#34;http://hb2012.org/&#34;&gt;Healthy Buildings&lt;/a&gt; is coming up next week. It’s all hands on deck at ILAQH while we put the finishing touches on the program and sort out the behind the scenes stuff. It’s going to be great. I’ll be giving two talks; the first is about how we can use the Dirichlet process for clustering in health survey data and the second is about the need for better statistics in science. ISBA 2012 was a heap of fun and there were lots of good talks. I find meeting other statisticians very inspiring. I will try to write a wrap-up when HB 2012 is over. For now, you can enjoy &lt;a href=&#34;http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2012/06/27/isba-2012-guest-post/&#34;&gt;my preliminary thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on Xian’s ’Og.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a talk I’m presenting at Healthy Buildings 2012 while I do some travel to ISBA. My supervisor, who is president of the Healthy Buildings conference this year, saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/2012/06/01/statistics-not-just-for-statisticians/&#34;&gt;a blog post of mine&lt;/a&gt; and thought that it would make a good presentation for the student plenary session. The basic point of the talk is that the quality of scientific research is greatly improved by ensuring that appropriate statistical analysis is performed and presented clearly. There have been so many papers and presentations I’ve seen where the authors just stop at descriptive statistics of their data and draw inferences just from describing the data. If we’re lucky they’ll do a t-test or ANOVA. If we’re not, they’ll just calculate summary statistics and perhaps a correlation between the response and the covariates rather than doing any statistical modelling. The problem isn’t restricted to indoor air quality and climate, the focus of this conference, though. &lt;a href=&#34;http://conidialcoleopticide.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;A friend of mine&lt;/a&gt; has come across the same issue in her literature review for using microbes to control insect pests. There are some groups doing some amazing scientific work with robust statistics, such as Hugh Possingham’s group at UQ who look at applying econometric principles to conservation (think triage for species rather than patients). At the risk of spoiling the ending of my talk, being “the statistician” in my group has given me the opportunity to work on some interesting aerosol science problems such as particle loss in instrumentation, the multi-modality of SMPS data and how it affects automatic processing, microbiology populations in classrooms, the fate of non-background ions and determining exposure measures from personal samplers and monitoring equipment that have different time steps. In turn, I have introduced the researchers I’m working with to new statistical techniques (often with R code) which they can adapt and use in future work. Every group needs a statistician in it, but not just to be handed the data to analyse and used as a black box where data goes in and analysis comes out. For starters, the statistician needs to know what the data actually describe. But the statistician should be there to build the skill set of the group. We can’t expect that every scientist has PhD level statistical skills but the scientist needs to be comfortable going beyond ANOVA to investigate what’s happening in their experimental or observational data. P.S. the title for this talk was inspired by a brief conversation with my ISBA room-mate about how great statistics-based puns are.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/./2012/06/12/hug-a-climate-scientist-day/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to Crikey.com.au’s “First Dog on the Moon” today, June 12, is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crikey.com.au/hug-a-climate-scientist-day-2012/&#34;&gt;Hug a Climate Scientist Day&lt;/a&gt;. The day was proclaimed by First Dog in response to the threats that climate scientists receive. The aim of the day is to show climate scientists that their work is appreciated and that we love them as people. I work in an air quality research group so it’s not difficult to find a climate scientist to hug (although not all of us in the group work in climate research). If you happen to not be one of the small group of people who have ready access to climate scientists, First Dog recommends you “&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.crikey.com.au/firstblog/files/2012/05/HugAClimateScientistJune.jpg&#34;&gt;find a fellow warmenist and cling trembling to each other in the knowledge that it’s too late for even the adorable climate scientists to save us&lt;/a&gt;”. I’m going to try to get a photo of me hugging a climate scientist today. Unfortunately, our group’s director isn’t in today.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rbloggers have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-bloggers.com/announcing-rpubs-a-new-web-publishing-service-for-r/&#34;&gt;announced the launch&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rpubs.com/&#34;&gt;RPubs&lt;/a&gt;, a free service which makes it easy to publish code and analysis on the web. It’s based on RStudio and the markdown package and looks like a great way for people to show analysis to co-workers who might not have R on their computers when you don’t feel like writing a report. I really like this idea and might end up using it in my office to show what we can do with statistics. Another thing I’ve been thinking about is the potential to use an Apple TV and its &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/au/appletv/airplay/&#34;&gt;screen sharing&lt;/a&gt; capabilities to do presentation work from iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. A lot of people in my office have iPhones, so an Apple TV hooked up to a HDMI screen (surely universities just leave these lying around) might be a good way to get a group of people to take some notes or share prepared slides with a small room of people. For example, if people had a PDF version of slides on their iPhones they could take control of the Apple TV and use their iPhone to flick through the slides, allowing everyone to stay in their seats and control the slideshow from their own device. I was excited by Google Wave when it first launched, as it combined a lot of what I liked about Gmail, Google Docs and Google Chat with an extension system, making it an incredibly powerful and flexible platform for collaborative work. Unfortunately it was released prematurely and died off after a flurry of uptake. Google Plus doesn’t really make up for it, either. I really liked the idea of collaboratively writing a document and being able to add in a voting gadget to resolve whether a section should be included. I used it socially to determine the dates of picnics with friends, which was probably where most of my use was directed. Probably the best example of how useful I found it was in writing a manual of procedures with about ten other volunteers who would ask questions. As we answered the questions, we folded the answers into the main part of the document. This was much more useful than writing a static document and then having a separate email list for discussion, or using track changes in Microsoft Word to email around a huge document that kept on growing. I have high hopes for the internet in terms of &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; collaboration, particularly academic collaboration. I find &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; really exciting because it allows me to work on a private project and then add a collaborator when they come on board. Once a project is finished and the paper published, that private repository can be made public and anyone can fork it and do with it what they will. If they’re intrigued by what’s been done, they could contact me and discuss what they’ve done and we can build a new project based on their fork of my work. With so much of my work being based on R or MATLAB and written up in LaTeX, I find this potential way of working quite sensible. Add in the fact that GitHub gives you a wiki system for each project and you’ve got a great tool at your disposal. A somewhat &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; collaborative tool that I organised is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/npbayes/Home&#34;&gt;wiki for QUT’s Bayesian Non-parametrics reading group&lt;/a&gt;. This is a repository for the collective work of the group, including Q&amp;amp;A on the papers we’re reading, notes from the meetings, a list of papers read, code chunks, links to videos explaining what we’re working on, etc. It’s been a really useful tool and I’d hope that others interested in the same work could use it as a resource for their own learning. There’s a lot of really cool stuff out there. It’s a matter of finding useful tools that don’t have particularly high barriers to entry and allow non-experts to view expertly produced material (like on RPubs). The longer it’s been since one was a student, the less likely one seems to be to adopt new workflow practices. I’ve suggested git to my supervisors as a good way for our groups to work but I have a feeling that none of them are interested enough in distributed version control to put the effort in to learning how to use them. So for now it’s annotated PDFs or printed pages with scribbles on them rather than making the edits to a LaTeX source file and committing and pushing their changes to a shared repository.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Statistics - not just for statisticians</title>
      <link>/./2012/06/01/statistics---not-just-for-statisticians/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jun 2012 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>

      <guid>/./2012/06/01/statistics---not-just-for-statisticians/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An article in &lt;a href=&#34;http://theconversation.edu.au/top-cited-academics-honoured-but-wheres-the-humanity-7348&#34;&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; made the rounds in our office yesterday and prompted a discussion with one of my colleagues about the role of statistics in scientific papers. The article itself talks about Australians who received an award from Thomson Reuters on the basis of publishing frequently cited work and discusses the different culture in science and the humanities when it comes to publication and citation. The basic argument is that the awards are skewed to the sciences where publication is traditionally by journal article and citation in other journal articles is picked up more than in the humanities where monographs/books are the traditional means of disseminating information. One of the academics interviewed makes the point that science is much more collaborative, with researchers working in teams to achieve the goals of a project. One of the email discussants in our group offered the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham Farquhar from the Australian National University is Australia’s citation laureate. Graham’s belief is this: start with a really good hypothesis driven question that no-one has answered and answer it. Deliver the answer with robust science and, voila, you have highly cited work. Coming up with the questions is hard though. Thinking seven impossible questions before breakfast is probably a daily norm in Graham’s existence. Doing this, and maintaining a normal personality is difficult though, but he manages quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A colleague talked to me about this idea of Farquhar’s in terms of a paper of his that he thought did well to answer an unanswered question. The aim of the paper was to offer an explanation for a physical phenomenon that is known in aerosols but it’s not well known why this phenomenon occurs. We then got into an argument about the robustness of the science, not based on the science that had been done (it was a synthesis of previous work by other authors), but because the evidence hadn’t all been included in a model that drew all these reviews together in a statistical manner. Scientists love &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; tests. They are simple tests which tell you if there’s a difference between two groups and are appropriate in some, but not all, instances, and are a good first step for exploratory data analysis. I was making the point that a Bayesian meta-analysis would have been far more appropriate as it’s a technique which is specifically designed to draw multiple sources of information together in a single model to provide a better estimate of an effect size. The Bayesian approach would have also helped here as a review of the literature could be used to determine priors such that even if no new data was collected for this paper, inferences could be drawn based on the current state of knowledge. I think every research group should hire a statistician, have them retrain the researchers in how to use statistics, including GLMs/GAMs, spatial analysis, time series methods, and Bayesian inference in order to build capacity within the group. The statistician can then work with the scientists to ensure that new papers include the best analysis of results possible and to also review old papers to see if there’s any low hanging fruit in terms of interesting experiments/observations which could be re-analysed with something more than ANOVA or linear regression. Statistics isn’t just for statisticians; we need to get away from the idea that doing more than the bare minimum for a paper is going too far. Apparently QUT is reviewing the way it teaches statistics to science students (something which is long overdue, my recollection is that MAB101 is an awful unit full of statistical techniques relevant to agricultural trials) so I’m hopeful that we can teach students statistical techniques that are relevant to them in an exciting way. I hope we don’t swing too far and just give them the exact tools they need and nothing else, because then we’re limiting graduates. If you’ve got the brain power to deal with atmospheric chemistry and/or physics, you should be able to handle statistics. Not everyone goes through to do advanced level statistical units but it shouldn’t be too much of a jump from collecting experimental data to analysing it in R with a package appropriate to your field. Edited to add: The point I’m trying to make here is that all researchers should have a basic understanding of exploratory/descriptive data analysis, simple GLMs (even if it’s just using glm() in R) and the ability to communicate the physical results in terms of the statistical modelling. I don’t expect that all scientists will go and become proficient in the use of Bayesian non-parametrics, but scientists should be able to start with some scatter plots, box plots and ANOVA to look for differences and then use regression to explain those differences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A few thoughts on the various software packages for stats</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a drink with a friend who works in health statistics. She uses SAS at work and asked me what kind of software I use to do my statistics. R and MATLAB, I responded. MATLAB because it’s fast and good and R because it’s free and has &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html&#34;&gt;heaps of additional packages&lt;/a&gt; to extend its use. A few days later she asked me if I’d seen &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-bloggers.com/will-2015-be-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-sas-and-spss/&#34;&gt;an article on R-bloggers&lt;/a&gt; predicting the end of the use of SAS in academic circles, with R overtaking SAS some time in 2015/16. Even discounting the R package system, the fact remains that R is far less cheaper than SAS or SPSS. As the GFC continues to bite hard and governments, universities and other large institutions look to shed unnecessary costs, perhaps R’s price ($0) will lead to its adoption. Institutional licenses for SAS and SPSS (and let’s throw MINITAB in there, as it’s also used) can’t be cheap and cutting out expensive software when a mature, free statistics environment (R+RStudio) is available would be a very simple way to reduce some ongoing costs. Support is available through companies like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.revolutionanalytics.com&#34;&gt;Revolution Analytics&lt;/a&gt; if the argument is that SAS support the software they sell. Yes, I’m a bit of an R evangelist, particularly in my research group where people don’t use SAS, Stata, SPSS, MINITAB or MATLAB but instead use Microsoft Excel (one of the worst pieces of software for statistical analysis). I would love to see R displace SAS, SPSS and other proprietary software packages in the next few years, but there’s another parallel objective; the quest to stop scientists using Excel for data analysis and modelling. It’s slow and based on an accounting spreadsheet. If we can get people off Excel and on to R (rather than SAS or SPSS, which would be attractive choices because they’ve heard of them somewhere and because they cost a lot of money they must be good) then academia as a whole will benefit immensely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my supervisors, Sama Low Choy, is always up for a chat about the role of visualisation in statistics and data analysis. An acolyte of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/&#34;&gt;Tufte&lt;/a&gt;, Sama is quite passionate about appropriate methods of presenting data. 3D pie charts, needless to say, are public enemy number one. We were having a chat this afternoon about how &lt;a href=&#34;http://conidialcoleopticide.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;a friend of mine&lt;/a&gt; who’s about to start a Masters in biology/statistics is a bit of a nerd when it comes to the presentation of data and copy. Talk turned to how easy it is to use LaTeX and how there’s a need for better visualisation in scientific results (something I’ve talked to some of my ILAQH colleagues about at length). Infographics are quite a popular thing at the moment, despite not always being particularly informative nor warranted, and I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;a blog about the process that the New York Times crew go through when developing infographics&lt;/a&gt; and other visualisation tools. Sama has forwarded me an email containing some of her favourite links that deal with the field of “data journalism”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioaerosols and lab reorganisation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had a meeting with my supervisor and two colleagues about looking at the microbiological measurements we’ve been taking as part of UPTECH. It was an interesting meeting if only for the chance to really see how the four of us are approaching this paper from the point of view of our backgrounds. Heidi Salonen, who has been working on microbiology with us since Caroline Duchaine went back to Canada, will be the lead author on the paper. She’s got a background in OH&amp;amp;S and this was really clear when she was talking about the need to quantify safe levels of microbiology. I was sitting there asking the questions that will shape the data analysis, like what sort of relationships we anticipate. Mandana Mazaheri was focussing on making use of the rest of the UPTECH data as best we can (we have a huge Access database) and Lidia Morawska was making sure none of us got carried away and that we could agree on an approach. I’m going to use this paper as an opportunity to push R as our statistical engine rather than Excel (which is all that scientists seem to use). I’m being brought on as the statistician and really don’t want to about learning how to use Excel and write VBA to do the things that can be done trivially in R. R’s plots are a lot better than what we tend to see in Excel and Mandana and I have been learning how polygon() works so we can shade the region between two particle diameter distributions in a plot for a report she’s working on. Mandana’s actually been quite good about learning R and seems to have stuck with it more than a lot of the other PhD students (except for Farhad Salimi, who is doing some really interesting work). I’d really like to use this paper as an opportunity to have people use git but Mandana and Heidi aren’t programmers, and I think even using R is going to stretch them. A &lt;a href=&#34;windows.github.com&#34;&gt;Windows GUI for git&lt;/a&gt; was released recently and I’m finding it better for committing and pushing than TortoiseGit or the command line git client as neither of these deal with my ssh keys particularly well. I don’t know what the deal is there. Perhaps it’s better under a more modern version of Windows. I also spent some time in the lab today helping reorganise it. Me being in the lab is a rarer event than the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/18141625&#34;&gt;recent annular eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t work in the lab and so am not responsible for the mess left over from experiments and not putting things away when I’m done, but I do rely on the lab’s monitoring data so it’s only fair that I help out from time to time. Just don’t ask me to help out with any of the science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of our researchers asked me to come along to a meeting next week to discuss my potential involvement on a paper as “the statistician”. It’s part of the UPTECH project but it’s not the spatial distribution of outdoor aerosols, which is what I’ve been working on for my PhD. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uku.fi/vaitokset/2009/ISBN978.951.802.908.6salonen.htm&#34;&gt;Heidi Salonen&lt;/a&gt;, a visiting researcher from Finland, is working on UPTECH looking at the concentration of microbiological agents in indoor air. Luckily I don’t have to be &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Spengler&#34;&gt;an expert on spores, moulds and fungus&lt;/a&gt; but it’ll be interesting to pick up a bit more knowledge from the quite broad field of aerosols. I’ve been asked a few times to be involved with some ILAQH projects but at the moment it’s been limited to helping write the statistical methodology for grant applications or discussing an approach for data from another part of the UPTECH project. As far as I recall, this is the first time that someone from ILAQH has come and said “Hey, I want you to be a co-author on this paper”. This sort of thing is what I’ve been looking forward to as I finish off my PhD, the chance to get out of my specific topic and start looking at other peoples’ work. I’ll probably try to recommend a non-parametric regression technique but I have a feeling it’ll be a classically designed experiment and that all we’ll need is some t-tests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open access and my next paper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got some substantial feedback from one of my supervisors earlier in the week and I’ve been chopping and changing this paper to ensure that the results section is more than just “Look at these graphs. They are graphs.” and that the introduction actually introduces the problem before leaping into how we propose to solve it. Another one of my supervisors will always pick me up on my use of informal language. I tend to write as if I’m explaining how I went about solving a problem, which is very well suited to tutorials, blogging and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/npbayes/home&#34;&gt;NP Bayes Wiki&lt;/a&gt; (the reading group is currently on hiatus) but less well suited to academic papers which will be sent to peer reviewed journals. I need to keep working on my formal scientific writing. Part of that probably means reading more academic papers from start to finish rather than skimming them for the information that I need. It probably also doesn’t help that most of the methodological stuff that I’m writing is drawn from the documentation and FAQs of an R package as well as personal communication with the authors of said package (said package is &lt;a href=&#34;www.r-inla.org&#34;&gt;R-INLA&lt;/a&gt;). I’ve got three papers on the go at the moment, so it’s going to be important that I can pick the low-hanging fruit of avoiding informal language so that my supervisors can concentrate on the actual work when giving me feedback. I’ve recently been spending a fair amount of time thinking about, and discussing with some colleagues, the issues of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecostofknowledge.com/&#34;&gt;Elsevier boycott&lt;/a&gt;, open access publishing and the use of preprint repositories like &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/&#34;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;. QUT supports open access to some extent by running an &lt;a href=&#34;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/&#34;&gt;ePrints&lt;/a&gt; repository, where university researchers are encouraged to deposit a preprint of their work (not the version published by the journal), and &lt;a href=&#34;http://libguides.library.qut.edu.au/content.php?pid=84068&amp;amp;sid=624559&#34;&gt;subscribing to, or taking out membership with&lt;/a&gt;, a few open access journals. Some of these are quite highly regarded, particularly publications by the Public Library of Science, such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/home.action&#34;&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of our papers at ILAQH end up in Elsevier’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.journals.elsevier.com/atmospheric-environment/&#34;&gt;Atmospheric Environment&lt;/a&gt;, quite a respectable journal, but I feel uncomfortable propping up a business with such a coercive business model that allows them to operate at a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/science/researchers-boycott-elsevier-journal-publisher.html?_r=1&#34;&gt;profit level of 36&lt;/a&gt;%. Sure, Adam Smith tells us that the baker is a baker not out of a love of bread but out of a desire to earn money with which to live, but we don’t have to accept the terms of business of one large company. I’m particularly interested in journals where the authors retain the copyright (or in the case of QUT, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mopp.qut.edu.au/D/D_03_01.jsp#D_03_01.05.mdoc&#34;&gt;the authors’ institution&lt;/a&gt;). I’m also a fan of journals which are innovating in the modern publishing environment, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amstat.org&#34;&gt;American Statistical Association&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jstatsoft.org/&#34;&gt;Journal of Statistical Software&lt;/a&gt; which is not only open access but publishes each article as its own issue of the journal, increasing the frequency of publication to a point where when an article’s reviewed it’s published straight away. I don’t like Elsevier’s business model and would be happy to look at publishing in high quality open access journals where the authors don’t have to sign away their copyright to the publishers. After all, it’s not the journals funding or doing the work. I believe granting the publishers a time-limited exclusive license to publish would be a far better model. There are other journals with a similar level of credibility and respect that don’t require authors to sign over copyright, don’t coerce libraries into taking big packages with unwanted journals bundled in and don’t freeze the person in the street out of reading the results of publicly funded research (a lot of research in Australia is funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.arc.gov.au/&#34;&gt;Australian Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, a government funding body). I don’t think Elsevier are evil, but they have a terrible business model in terms of disseminating high quality research to the public in an affordable manner. There are others out there doing a better job and researchers should support them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second paper of my PhD is really taking shape. It’s on spatial and temporal modelling of panel design data from the UPTECH project and has been a lot of fun to work on. I said it should be ready by the end of the week for the final comments by my supervisors and it looks like it’ll be on time, too. Once I’ve got that feedback it’s time to submit it and start work on paper 3 (which follows from paper 2). I’ll be so glad when this is over and I can look forward to finishing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a second piece that came out of Channel Ten’s visit to ILAQH a few months ago and it’s about to go to air. Two other PhD students at ILAQH are featured in a piece for the Scope episode “Dirty Science”. The show is aimed at a slightly older audience and the segment features me talking about dust storms, Leigh talking about (if I recall correctly) the instrumentation that we use to measure the physical and chemical properties of aerosols, and Lingli talking about particle deposition in the lung. The segment will air in the 4pm time slot on Thursday 29 March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using R</title>
      <link>/./2012/03/12/using-r/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am the only statistician in my aerosol science research group; everyone else is either a physicist, chemist, environmental scientist, engineer or some other physical scientist. Most of the people in the group do their data analysis and/or plotting in Excel or custom software like IGOR or Origin. One or two people in the group have used MATLAB in the past but there’s some sort of opportunity cost effect where it’s easier to use the Data Analysis plug-in in Excel than to load up MATLAB and remember how to fit a GLM or perform ANOVA. My background in computational mathematics and a bit of statistics means I’ve been exposed to other mathematics and statistics software and I’ve grown accustomed, through my stats research group, to seeing novel statistical methods and data analysis done in appropriate software packages (R, MATLAB, WinBUGS, and a Python package called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ccdamc.org.au/files/beachbayes/ChrisStrickland.pdf&#34;&gt;pyMCMC&lt;/a&gt; that some of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eprints.qut.edu.au/43469/&#34;&gt;my colleagues&lt;/a&gt; are working on). As such, it saddens me to see my fellow PhD students doing their stats and plotting in Excel (which has certainly come in leaps and bounds but is still not a good piece of statistical software). I’ve really been pushing &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; as a way of doing better data analysis and making better looking graphs (which can easily be exported as PDF or EPS files) over the last year or so and have been heartened to see that a) it’s recognised as a good tool and b) some people are using the scripts I have written for them to do things like randomly sample from a list of strings. One of the other PhD students has found an R package that will make our lives much easier, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.openair-project.org/&#34;&gt;openair&lt;/a&gt;, and has even started investigating how to use R to do repeated calculations of summary statistics from SMPS data rather than writing the formula in a spreadsheet cell in Excel and choosing “fill down”. The risk here, of course, is that we will be asked to write all the statistics code for everyone else. In addition to this, one of the PhD students in the stats research group decided to run a short course in using R (with RStudio, which I’m now attempting to use instead of Notepad++ and NppToR) to manipulate data and do some simple plotting in ggplot2 and most of the (eight) students in my room went to the course. They all got various things out of going but all agreed that using R is the way to go. Some still find more advanced data analysis than t-tests, ANOVA and linear regression a bit daunting but will soldier on with the short courses that are being organised. There’s a bit of a feeling among the aerosol science PhD students that I should teach them data analysis in R, as I’m familiar with both what they’re working on (and thus have some idea of what they need to learn) and with them as people so I’ve got an idea of the sort of level of statistics and mathematics they’ve got. Now’s probably not the time for me to start teaching (PhD to finish) but it looks like I might be around for a little while so if I can help build the capacity of the group then I’d be more than happy to show everyone how to do their favourite data analysis in R and perhaps extend them a little further as scientists. While everyone brings their own strengths to the group in terms of skill sets and bodies of knowledge, I believe that every scientist should be able to do their own data analysis and that they should be able to do it in statistical software rather than something which has been developed for generating accounting reports and has later had scripting and statistical routines shoe-horned on to it (and while widely available isn’t free and “free”).&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/./2012/02/23/dust-storms---totally-wild/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up as a child in the 1990s in Australia meant watching “&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_Wild&#34;&gt;Totally Wild&lt;/a&gt;” after school. Totally Wild is a show about the natural environment in Australia and its many facets. Ranger Tim and Ranger Stacy (from the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service) would talk about conservation, biodiversity, the urban environment and Australian ecosystems of a weekday afternoon. It wasn’t my favourite show and I would often channel surf in an attempt to find something better to watch (I think it was mainly the theme music that put me off the show) but every once in a while there’d be something quite fascinating on and I’d sit and watch it. Given that the only other environment-themed show on TV at the time appeared to be Captain Planet, it’s pretty neat that Channel Ten put some resources into making a show about Australia’s natural environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late last year I was approached by my primary supervisor, Lidia Morawska, to be part of a piece on dust storms for Totally Wild that was going to be filmed in our lab. Yes. Of course. Not a moment of hesitation. I don’t consider myself an aerosol scientist but I couldn’t help get caught up in the excitement in September 2009 when a dust storm hit the East coast of Australia. Our group published &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231011004481&#34;&gt;a paper on the dust storm&lt;/a&gt; and this was the basis of the Totally Wild piece. The script went through a few revisions, attempting to balance “punchy” with “scientifically accurate” and it was a great way to spend a Friday afternoon, talking to an excitable TV crew about the work that we do at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au/&#34;&gt;ILAQH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a piece still to come on &lt;a href=&#34;http://ten.com.au/scope.htm&#34;&gt;Scope&lt;/a&gt; which will feature some speaking parts by Leigh Crilley (atmospheric chemistry) and Lingli Guo (lung deposition) who are shown in the Totally Wild Piece. The Scope piece will go deeper into the aerosol research that we do, not just the formation of dust storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Totally Wild piece can be viewed at the following link: &lt;a href=&#34;http://ten.com.au/video-player.htm?movideo_p=41457&amp;amp;movideo_m=162536&#34;&gt;Totally Wild - S2, E37 part 2/3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing up as a child in the 1990s in Australia meant watching “&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_Wild&#34;&gt;Totally Wild&lt;/a&gt;” after school. Totally Wild is a show about the natural environment in Australia and its many facets. Ranger Tim and Ranger Stacy (from the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service) would talk about conservation, biodiversity, the urban environment and Australian ecosystems of a weekday afternoon. It wasn’t my favourite show and I would often channel surf in an attempt to find something better to watch (I think it was mainly the theme music that put me off the show) but every once in a while there’d be something quite fascinating on and I’d sit and watch it.
