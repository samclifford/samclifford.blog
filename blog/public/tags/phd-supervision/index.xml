      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEB113 students really seemed to enjoy looking at mathematical modelling last week. &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nM_X1PTccloC&amp;amp;lpg=PA111&amp;amp;ots=dCzeaDpIeb&amp;amp;dq=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&amp;amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;The Lotka-Volterra equations&lt;/a&gt; continue to be a good teaching tool. A student pointed out that when reviewing the limit idea for derivatives it’d be useful to show it with approximating the circumference of a circle using a polygon. So I knocked this up: &lt;a href=&#34;https://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/approximations.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;approximations.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;approximations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Are you interested in big data and/or air quality? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/student-topics/big-data-and-nanoparticles-modelling-complex-spatio-temporal-variation&#34;&gt;Consider doing a PhD with me&lt;/a&gt;. This week I showed in the workshop how Markov chains are a neat application of linear algebra for dealing with probability. We used &lt;a href=&#34;http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/&#34;&gt;this interactive visualisation&lt;/a&gt; to investigate what happens as the transition probabilities change. Zoubin Ghahramani has written &lt;a href=&#34;http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1984/20110553.abstract&#34;&gt;a really nice review paper&lt;/a&gt; of Bayesian non-parametrics that I really recommend checking out if you’re interested in the new modelling techniques that have been coming out in the last few years for complex data sets. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2014/09/exercism/&#34;&gt;Exercism.io&lt;/a&gt; is a new service for learning how to master programming by getting feedback on exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es403721w&#34;&gt;Our personal sampling paper got accepted for publication&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;&#34;&gt;quite quickly once we’d made the changes the reviewers required. This paper came from almost nothing about a year and a half ago to a really nice piece of mathematical and statistical modelling that will give us a lot to work with in future UPTECH papers, where we’ll be looking at the relationship between inhaled dose and child health. I’m presenting this work at the EMAC2013 conference next week (gotta write slides!) so it’s good to have the paper online now.&lt;/span&gt; My current post-doc is drawing to a close at the end of the year but I’ve got the contract in the email for my position for the next few years. After that, who knows? We got a grant under an international exchange program which means I may be off overseas for a few weeks/months during my next appointment. I’m looking forward to being able to spend some time outside the country at another university, having got a bit more experience now than when I went to Finland about two years in to my PhD. And it looks like I’m about to get my second PhD student to co-supervise.&lt;/p&gt;
