      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/2013/06/06/trips-interstate/&#34; title=&#34;Trips interstate&#34;&gt;The other week, when I was in Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, I caught up a friend who’s moved down there and is working in a similar role to me (albeit with a much larger group). He’s got a similar background to me; we both studied mathematics at QUT and focussed on computational and applied mathematics units but we now find ourselves working in (bio-)statistics&lt;em&gt;. I stayed in academia when he went off to work in industry but he has earned a Masters in computational statistics and has picked up Bayesian stats. We both learned Bayesian stats through Gelman, Carlin, Stern and Rubin’s “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/&#34;&gt;Bayesian Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;”, a book which is known to the Bayesian PhD students at QUT as “The Bible”; it’s been used by just about every lecturer that has taught the Honours level Bayesian Data Analysis class. In addition to The Bible, other Bayesian resources I’ve leaned on over the last few years are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/&#34;&gt;Gelman and Hill’s book on hierarchical models&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/&#34;&gt;Gelman’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. My friend and I got talking about Gelman’s work and how of late we seem to be disagreeing with some of the choices he makes in modelling. For my part, I don’t agree with (or is it understand?) the decisions in Gelman’s Bayesian approach to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/econanova3.pdf&#34;&gt;ANOVA&lt;/a&gt; (focussing more on the variance parameters than the means) and the particular parameterisation of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&amp;amp;id=pdf_1&amp;amp;handle=euclid.ba/1340371048&#34;&gt;global variance parameter&lt;/a&gt; when he discusses the use of a folded non-central &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; distribution. Now, it’s not that I think Gelman is wrong where he was previously right or that he’s losing the plot (after all, these papers are years old), but as I read his blog about the models he’s fitting now I’m coming to the realisation that I had been following what he’d been saying and am now looking elsewhere and seeing other ways of doing things. There are many different approaches that each have their strengths and weaknesses and philosophical (and practical) idiosyncrasies. One of the strengths of the Bayesian approach is that the incorporation of priors in the modelling approach gives you a very flexible class of models (hierarchical Bayesian modelling is one of the most useful tools I’ve picked up) and allows you a great amount of freedom in choosing how to build your priors. There is no one correct prior for each problem&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt;; you can use a Jeffreys’ prior if you really want to go down the path of non-informativity or if you’re content with (and can justify) a weakly informative Normal(0, 1e-6) or Gamma(0.001, 0.001). Sometimes you can even choose an appropriately flat prior that results in the posteriors of your parameters having the same distribution as the frequentist approach (where the 95% confidence interval and credible intervals have the same values, but not the same interpretations of course). Sometimes it’s appropriate to elicit a prior from experts or the literature and go for a very informative prior if you don’t have much data in your experiment/observation^. There are lots of different ways to do things, lots of papers pushing different approaches. As a student you tend to look up to people as paragons of the field and go “Well if Gelman did it that way then I’d better do that too”; after four years of study I feel more comfortable looking at something and saying “No, I disagree”. I may not always be doing it the best way possible but I’ll always try to justify what I’ve done both to my collaborators and to the editor/reader of my papers. If it turns out I’ve done something wrong, so be it; I can always try again and learn from the experience. &lt;/em&gt; I’m yet to hear a satisfactory explanation as to what the difference is between a biostatistician and a statistician. § It’s worth checking out some of the ideas of so-called &lt;a href=&#34;http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue03/berger.pdf&#34;&gt;Objective Bayes&lt;/a&gt; if subjectivity is something you’re concerned about. ^ Whatever you do, check your sensitivity to your choice of priors.&lt;/p&gt;

Opening up the conference with live streaming is a cheap way to engage the wider public (but risks potential attendees deciding to stay home and watch rather than engaging with the rest of the conference). A youth session is also a really good way to engage in some inter-generational communication by giving the younger researchers a stage for setting out their vision. &lt;a href=&#34;http://f1000research.com/data-policies&#34;&gt;These journals&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t view publication of data as prior publication when assessing an article based on that data. I spent last week in Sydney with Guy Marks’ group at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.woolcock.org.au/&#34;&gt;Woolcock Institute of Medical Research&lt;/a&gt;. I first met Marks at Bayesian data analysis course run by Kerrie Mengersen; he &lt;a href=&#34;http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/people/academics/profiles/guym.php&#34;&gt;does work&lt;/a&gt; on tuberculosis in Vietnam. Christian Robert, a collaborator of Mengersen’s, just gave 40 students in Ho Chi Minh City a crash course in Bayesian statistics. The slides are available &lt;a href=&#34;http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/teaching-bayesian-statistics-in-hochimin-city/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking of Bayesian stats, the term “derp” is apparently a &lt;a href=&#34;http://au.businessinsider.com/sorry-haters-derp-isnt-going-away-2013-6&#34;&gt;Bayesian way of describing the way someone believes something so strongly&lt;/a&gt; (their prior) that they can not be swayed by data. I’m going to be doing a lot more work teaching people how to use R in the near future. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239625/Beginner_s_guide_to_R_Introduction&#34;&gt;This looks like a handy resource for beginners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trips interstate</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m writing this morning while sitting in the corridor at the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, Glebe NSW. I’m down here visiting some collaborators from the UPTECH project, working on reconciling the survey data from the 600 or so surveys that were sent home with school children during the UPTECH project. It’s different work to anything I’ve done because it involves sitting at a desk with another person and working together for the entire day. We’re double checking everything, sorting out our method and then implementing it where normally I’d just be mucking around and seeing what worked. We have a very disjoint set of skills as I’ve got a background in statistical computation and my colleague is an epidemiologist in a medical science group. This has its pros and cons, of course, because we can’t work in SAS/Access (what she’s used to) nor in R/MATLAB (what I’m used to). So a lot of it’s being done in Excel and custom add-ins for the time being. I have a feeling that today will be the day we start rifling through the boxes of paper surveys and comparing them to the double entered electronic versions. I’m staying with my sister-in-law in Botany while I’m in Sydney this week, which requires about an hour commute each way (if I get the right bus). Long commutes is apparently just what people do in Sydney. My sister-in-law works in Liverpool and drives 1-1.5 hours each way rather than spending two hours on public transport. It’s been a while since I’ve been in Sydney and I forget just how spread out the urban area is. I’m used to staying in Pymble and getting trains everywhere or crashing at friends’ places in the Inner West and being able to walk. It’s two buses from Botany to Glebe and the bus home can take a very long time to get out of the CBD and inner suburbs. Still, it’s nice to be able to walk around Glebe Point at lunch time. On Friday we’ll probably be visited by a few academics that I met last Friday a the &lt;a href=&#34;http://car-cre.org.au/&#34;&gt;CAR&lt;/a&gt; Investigators’ meeting in Melbourne. The meeting was the first time I’d met the group that are funding my 0.75FTE postdoctoral fellowship. It was great to meet the other post-docs (Christine Cowie, Martine Dennekamp, Yuming Guo) and see what they’re all working on. It’s quite a diverse group of people and projects in CAR and everyone was very excited about the prospect of even more collaboration withing the centre. This is the first time I’ve had any real contact with the centre; there are monthly seminars that are hosted using Adobe Connect but I’ve always been tutoring SEB113 when they’ve been on, so I haven’t had a chance to make it to any of them. I’ve caught up with Steve, a friend from undergrad maths at QUT who now lives down here and is doing computational statistics for an HIV research group. We had a drink and dinner last night (Tipple Bar and Bistro and Yulli’s vegetarian restaurant). We seem to have developed quite similar views on the role of stats in science and Bayesian statistics. We should keep in touch more, though, because it totally slipped my mind that he got married. The colleague I’m visiting here took me out to dinner in Newtown last night with her partner, where we stuffed ourselves full of Thai food and then decided to get some pastizzi but to go for a walk before attempting to eat them. I managed to eat two of them once I finally got home, and there’s a cherry cheese one waiting in my bag for morning tea once we earn ourselves a break (we’re using the Pomodoro technique to great effect). I’m not drinking as much coffee while I’m down here, which is partly due to my brother and sister-in-law not drinking coffee and the Woolcock Institute not being located within a university.&lt;/p&gt;
