      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.applieddatamining.info/&#34;&gt;Applied Data Mining group&lt;/a&gt; has an opening for a one year position as a research officer with the group, working on topics in data mining and machine learning (which appears to be a less rigorous Bayesian non-parametrics). So if you or someone you know is finishing a PhD in statistics, machine learning or computer science and knows how to do scientific computation/data mining for big data and wouldnâ€™t mind working in lovely, subtropical Brisbane, Australia for a year, email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:r.nayak@qut.edu.au&#34;&gt;Associate Professor Richi Nayak&lt;/a&gt; this week. Some selection criteria are under the cut. The successful application should have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed the PhD (or nearly completed) with success as evidenced by publications in proceedings of important conferences and journals in the field of machine learning/ data mining;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquired a profound knowledge and practical experience in machine learning, data mining and information retrieval; experience with Big Data is an advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good programming skills (e.g., Java, C++, MATLAB, Python);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience with data mining tools such as WEKA, SAS, MSQLServer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent English language skills (written and spoken);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good communication skills especially for interacting with industry partners;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The capability to work independently and in a team;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
