      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEB113 students really seemed to enjoy looking at mathematical modelling last week. &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nM_X1PTccloC&amp;amp;lpg=PA111&amp;amp;ots=dCzeaDpIeb&amp;amp;dq=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&amp;amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;The Lotka-Volterra equations&lt;/a&gt; continue to be a good teaching tool. A student pointed out that when reviewing the limit idea for derivatives it’d be useful to show it with approximating the circumference of a circle using a polygon. So I knocked this up: &lt;a href=&#34;https://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/approximations.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;approximations.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;approximations&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Are you interested in big data and/or air quality? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/student-topics/big-data-and-nanoparticles-modelling-complex-spatio-temporal-variation&#34;&gt;Consider doing a PhD with me&lt;/a&gt;. This week I showed in the workshop how Markov chains are a neat application of linear algebra for dealing with probability. We used &lt;a href=&#34;http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/&#34;&gt;this interactive visualisation&lt;/a&gt; to investigate what happens as the transition probabilities change. Zoubin Ghahramani has written &lt;a href=&#34;http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1984/20110553.abstract&#34;&gt;a really nice review paper&lt;/a&gt; of Bayesian non-parametrics that I really recommend checking out if you’re interested in the new modelling techniques that have been coming out in the last few years for complex data sets. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wired.com/2014/09/exercism/&#34;&gt;Exercism.io&lt;/a&gt; is a new service for learning how to master programming by getting feedback on exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ntnu.edu/&#34;&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt; in Trondheim, Norway, has &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/a/r-inla.org/www/events/openphd-grants&#34;&gt;five PhD fellowships&lt;/a&gt; open. Visualising homicide rates in Mexico &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/02/26/excited-by-willingness-to-help-get-things-done/&#34;&gt;using R and GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.statisticsblog.com/2014/03/the-week-in-stats-mar-3rd-edition/&#34;&gt;Probability and Statistics Blog&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re in Melbourne, Australia, you should consider popping along to &lt;a href=&#34;http://thelaborastory.com/&#34;&gt;Laborastory&lt;/a&gt; at the Cider House (Brunswick), where five scientists get up on the first Tuesday of the month to tell the stories of the heroes and history of their field. A friend of mine went along this week and enjoyed it immensely. SEB113 has started again. I’ve already done 5 workshops (I have three a week). Introducing a whole new cohort of students to R, RStudio and ggplot. We did some paper plane throwing last week and had a look at how simple usage of faceting, colouring and stacking histograms can reveal both overall variation and group-to-group variation. A few students are still bewildered by the idea of writing code to make pictures but they recognise that it’s just a case of needing practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upworthy.com/one-guy-with-a-marker-just-made-the-global-warming-debate-completely-obsolete-7&#34;&gt;Here’s an interesting but simple discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the risk analysis of action on climate change. What I like is that the author encourages the viewer to play around with the outcomes rather than using an appeal to authority that states “this is what the IPCC and other climate scientists say will happen”. it’s a very Bayesian way of asking people to consider risk, not just in the conditional statement sense but in the sense that one’s personal subjective belief is viewed as a welcome addition to the discussion. So much of the climate debate seems to be based on whether or not the IPCC is right; some people don’t like that the IPCC is an international body of elite scientists and so will ignore anything they say. Couching the exercise in terms of “Any reasonable person should be able to concede that they may be wrong about the way the physical world behaves” takes it away from “who is right and who is wrong?”. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usq.edu.au/scholarships/usq/australian-postgraduate-award&#34;&gt;USQ has some APA PhD scholarships available&lt;/a&gt;, including scholarships for computational mathematics and climate risk and resource management. So if you’re interested in $30,000 per year (tax free!) to work on some interesting topics check out the USQ site. Problems with the interpretation of p values are &lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesianbiologist.com/2011/08/21/p-value-fallacy-on-more-or-less/&#34;&gt;often due to people treating them as statements about their hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; given some data when they’re really statements about the data given some hypothesis. Any SEB113 students reading would do well to remember this. I’ve also &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/2013/10/18/response-to-a-student-on-p-values/&#34; title=&#34;Response to a student on p values&#34;&gt;blogged my response&lt;/a&gt; to an SEB113 student about this. &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/15/teaching-least-squares-to-a-5th-grader-by-calibrating-a-programmable-robot/&#34;&gt;Here’s a cute little video&lt;/a&gt; about using least squares regression to figure out how many revolutions a Lego Mindstorms robot’s wheel needs to turn to make it travel 1m. It’s an interesting use of regression as a calibration technique, which is something we haven’t covered explicitly in SEB113 but I imagine it’d be pretty common in engineering classes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/10/23/why-is-grey-literature-not-open-access/&#34;&gt;Interesting post at the Thesis Whisperer&lt;/a&gt; asking why work that’s owned by someone (as in the intellectual property rights are assigned) but not copyrighted by a commercial publisher isn’t more freely available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The email below the cut details three PhD programs that are based on the level above me in the Biopesticides lab at QUT. All projects involve collaboration with researchers in the UK; the mathematics project involves collaborating with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/contact/details/whites&#34;&gt;researchers at Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and the other two with researchers at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cabi.org&#34;&gt;CABI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fileshare.qut.edu.au/public/hauxwell/Higher_Degrees_Research_Projects_Proposal_Form___chemistry.pdf&#34;&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; - The interaction between insect cuticular chemistry and pathology and gene expression in Metarhizium anisopliae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://fileshare.qut.edu.au/public/hauxwell/Higher_Degrees_Research_Projects_Proposal_Form___maths.pdf&#34;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; - Development of mathematical models of insect pathogen dynamics&lt;/li&gt;
