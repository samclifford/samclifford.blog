      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Possingham’s lab at UQ is advertising four postdoc positions. &lt;a href=&#34;http://uqjobs.uq.edu.au/jobDetails.asp?sJobIDs=495300&amp;amp;stp=AW&#34;&gt;Two from an ARC Laureate Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://uqjobs.uq.edu.au/jobDetails.asp?sJobIDs=495304&amp;amp;stp=AW&#34;&gt;two through the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions&lt;/a&gt;. The positions are three years full time and focus on mathematics and statistics rather than ecological fieldwork. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has &lt;a href=&#34;http://martynplummer.wordpress.com/2013/12/10/postdoctoral-opportunity-at-iarc-2/&#34;&gt;a postdoc position&lt;/a&gt; as well. I had my PhD graduation ceremony yesterday. &lt;a href=&#34;img_2653a.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2653a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;IMG_2653a&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to not be a very confident public speaker. I remember getting up at a community meeting in 2007 and stammering some words out to a group of residents; it was a disaster. Motivated for the desire for some money to augment my Youth Allowance payments I applied to be a tutor with the School of Mathematics (QUT) during my final years of undergrad and found that I became a bit better at talking to people. My Honours seminar was still a nervous affair but it was much less disastrous than the community meeting. After Honours I had a job teaching mathematics to a group of video game programmers, developing the curriculum to suit their needs and interests and it’s here that I became far more comfortable with speaking. I was coming up with my own material and delivering it to people who I knew were interested in it. That’s a world away from teaching university students, where many may not see the point in learning what I’m teaching. This is especially the case in service mathematics and statistics units. During my PhD studies I got interested in improvised theatre as a creative alternative to the mathematics, statistics and science that was my day. My reputation as someone not afraid to get up in front of 100 people and perform lead to my being asked by one of my PhD supervisors if I’d like to be a tutor in the brand new SEB113 course. Teaching students how to use R for their data analysis? Of course I’m interested! After the end of a very enjoyable, if somewhat disjointed, semester I was asked if I’d consider lecturing the smaller second semester re-run. I jumped at the chance. Restructuring the subject from the way it was run in first semester meant we could focus on the way the material flowed and see if we could smooth out some of the jumps in style, making the unit more consistent and easier to understand. We had to do a lot of work rejigging the slides, writing new workshops and computer laboratory worksheets to accommodate the use of ggplot rather than a combination of base, lattice and MASS graphics. The result was a subject that introduces a diverse list of topics in a much more sensible manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measurement and variation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary statistics and confidence intervals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inference and sample size, hypothesis tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression lines of best fit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression with a categorical variable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-linear regression based on process models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multivariate summary statistics and regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematical modelling of process models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra, including the guts of how linear regression works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing scientifically, revisiting the scientific method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing about numbers, conditional probability for understanding hypothesis tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revisiting visualisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to advanced quantitative methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became apparent around week 8-9 that what we were doing was telling a story of how to get from calculating means to understanding how to develop a model to either model a process or emulate that process. The discussions about writing scientifically became about how the quantitative reports were telling a story. The first step, the introduction, is like meeting the characters for the first time and understanding their relationships with each other. As we move through the methods and analysis we see the action of the story unfold. The conclusion is the consequences of the action and by relating the analysis back to the motivating aim we can see the arc of the story and understand more about these characters. Now that the teaching is over and the marking of the quantitative workbooks is coming to a close, I’ve got a bit more space in my head to process my thoughts about improvisation and storytelling (we do a weekly show and I’m still doing workshops on the weekend). I’ve picked up a book on my Kindle by scientist-turned-filmmaker Randy Olson, entitled “&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FASMHP8/ref=oh_d__o00_details_o00__i00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Connection: Hollywood Storytelling meets Critical Thinking&lt;/a&gt;”. Olson’s book is all about how any intellectual topic can be made interesting and accessible by treating its presentation as telling a story. He states that we, as humans, engage with stories far more than we do with dry information as we feel stories it in our hearts, guts and sexual organs rather than just in our brains. Not only is the communication of scientific results storytelling but lecturing is storytelling. I’ve thought this semester that lecturing is definitely a style of performance, but the idea that the topics in a unit should follow an arc and tell a unified story means that part of the academic’s role is telling a story in the classroom. For me, that means that elements of comedy, pantomime and suspense make their way into my lectures. Storytelling in science is a very interesting topic and I look forward to making my way through the remainder of the book over the end of year break, ready to start a new semester with a revised narrative arc and better storyboarding, maybe even a few new characters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just got the letter from QUT informing me that the university has decided to confer the degree. I am now entitled to use the title “Dr.”, even though it’d be weird for me to insist on it. I should get business cards or something. Maybe a suit. Better update my CV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.upworthy.com/one-guy-with-a-marker-just-made-the-global-warming-debate-completely-obsolete-7&#34;&gt;Here’s an interesting but simple discussion&lt;/a&gt; of the risk analysis of action on climate change. What I like is that the author encourages the viewer to play around with the outcomes rather than using an appeal to authority that states “this is what the IPCC and other climate scientists say will happen”. it’s a very Bayesian way of asking people to consider risk, not just in the conditional statement sense but in the sense that one’s personal subjective belief is viewed as a welcome addition to the discussion. So much of the climate debate seems to be based on whether or not the IPCC is right; some people don’t like that the IPCC is an international body of elite scientists and so will ignore anything they say. Couching the exercise in terms of “Any reasonable person should be able to concede that they may be wrong about the way the physical world behaves” takes it away from “who is right and who is wrong?”. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usq.edu.au/scholarships/usq/australian-postgraduate-award&#34;&gt;USQ has some APA PhD scholarships available&lt;/a&gt;, including scholarships for computational mathematics and climate risk and resource management. So if you’re interested in $30,000 per year (tax free!) to work on some interesting topics check out the USQ site. Problems with the interpretation of p values are &lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesianbiologist.com/2011/08/21/p-value-fallacy-on-more-or-less/&#34;&gt;often due to people treating them as statements about their hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; given some data when they’re really statements about the data given some hypothesis. Any SEB113 students reading would do well to remember this. I’ve also &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/2013/10/18/response-to-a-student-on-p-values/&#34; title=&#34;Response to a student on p values&#34;&gt;blogged my response&lt;/a&gt; to an SEB113 student about this. &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/15/teaching-least-squares-to-a-5th-grader-by-calibrating-a-programmable-robot/&#34;&gt;Here’s a cute little video&lt;/a&gt; about using least squares regression to figure out how many revolutions a Lego Mindstorms robot’s wheel needs to turn to make it travel 1m. It’s an interesting use of regression as a calibration technique, which is something we haven’t covered explicitly in SEB113 but I imagine it’d be pretty common in engineering classes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/10/23/why-is-grey-literature-not-open-access/&#34;&gt;Interesting post at the Thesis Whisperer&lt;/a&gt; asking why work that’s owned by someone (as in the intellectual property rights are assigned) but not copyrighted by a commercial publisher isn’t more freely available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’ve discussed this before but there’s a huge difference in culture between the two research groups I’m involved with. ILAQH (physics) meets once every four to six months at the moment and BRAG (statistics) meets fortnightly. At the fortnightly meetings we spend a few minutes having a quick check-in around the room where we discuss what we’ve been up to for the last two weeks (any papers published, talks given, new research plans) and then someone will give a talk on a topic that is within a semester-long theme. The theme last semester was visualisation, now we’re moving on to the analysis of big data. ILAQH, by contrast, meets at a frequency that doesn’t really facilitate a catch-up. Instead, any big developments in the big projects are discussed and visitors are welcomed and/or farewelled appropriately. Both meetings serve different purposes in different ways. One of the biggest benefits of the BRAG fortnightly meetings is that PhD students get a lot of practice giving talks. You’re almost expected to give a talk once a semester, and students are encouraged to give practice talks for the milestones of their PhD candidature (confirmation at 12 months, final seminar when completed). Given that it’s typically two and a half years between confirmation and the final seminar, being expected to give a talk every few months means that you get practice at talking and that the practice is somewhat regular. This will be especially important for ILAQH students as an overwhelming majority of our students are not native English speakers. Getting regular practice at academic speaking will help when it comes to final seminars. I’ve spoken to Lidia Morawska (Director of ILAQH) about setting up such a system and she thinks it’s a good idea. Now I’ve just got to check that the rest of the group sees it as valuable and then put the legwork in to get it off the ground (organise a time, book a room, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ex Post Docto</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now at the half-way point in my year-long postdoctoral fellowship. Since the start of the year the number of papers submitted with my name on them has approximately doubled, I’ve got my name on some grant applications (some successful, some not) and am co-writing a proposal for a PhD student position at ILAQH that I will likely end up co-supervising. It’s been quite the experience so far and it’s really only just getting started. I’ve been applying for lecturing positions at QUT and will continue to look further afield to see what’s out there that inspires me. Today the staff and post-docs in my group had a meeting to discuss the handling of lab business and how we maintain our space. For the longest time I’ve felt like a bit of an outsider, particularly with regards to lab stuff. I couldn’t tell you how to maintain a CPC, what the difference between a P-trak and Q-trak is or how to compare SMPS to NSAM data. I was not a member of the measurement team for UPTECH and my involvement in the research is mainly through data analysis and statistical consultation. Being given responsibilities within the lab is still a bit strange to me but I’m very happy to be helping out, as I am part of a team and I rely on those around me for my work. Statistics doesn’t happen in a vacuum (unless you’re a probabilist). A friend of a friend is finishing up their chemistry PhD and looking for work for next semester and beyond. They’re applying for a more technical job and we spent some time this evening with our mutual friend (who has recently started a postdoc) discussing how to rearrange the CV in order to best highlight their experience. I showed &lt;a href=&#34;http://samclifford.info/?attachment_id=291&#34;&gt;my own CV&lt;/a&gt; to explain what I wanted to highlight, as all three of us had different opinions on style, format, the flow of the text and whether to include a photograph or not. Obviously I’m pitching myself at academic, rather than technical, positions and I said that I believe professional experience in a lab is far more important to show off than academic awards from undergrad. An interesting moment in the conversation was the disbelief from the friend of a friend that I would make my CV so public. Why wouldn’t I want to show the world who I am, what I’m working on and what I’m interested in? It appears that developing multiple versions of a CV is necessary in order to have something to send to different bodies. University faculties are looking for a very different set of attributes than the Australian Research Council or other funding groups. I haven’t yet managed to whittle my CV down to two pages but I suspect it would include removing much of the tutoring and undergraduate experience I’ve had, my radio and TV interviews and conference organisation background, focussing instead on my top publications, professional experience and track record with grants. I will continue to need to tweak my CV as I continue to apply for jobs and this means having a look around for good resources from those who have gone before me. Some examples of advice I’ve come across are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://theresearchwhisperer.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/postdoc-chances/&#34;&gt;Boost your postdoc chances (at The Research Whisperer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2011/05/26/what-if-your-cv-is-not-enough-part-one/&#34;&gt;What if your CV is not enough? (at The Thesis Whisperer)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trockeneisbombe.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/the-transit-from-phd-student-to-post-doc/&#34;&gt;The transit from PhD student to post-doc (at Trockeneisbombe)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those blogs are worth following anyway. The next six months will be a challenge, as I attempt to juggle the remaining time in this postdoc with other commitments and the need to find ongoing employment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some people make their visualisations in Excel, I make mine in R and others still use things like Processing or InDesign. Bret Victor &lt;a href=&#34;http://vimeo.com/66085662&#34;&gt;shows us&lt;/a&gt; how the various ideas from each approach can be combined to make dynamic visualisations. It’s written with a view to &lt;a href=&#34;http://andrewgelman.com/2013/05/17/how-can-statisticians-help-psychologists-do-their-research-better/&#34;&gt;the interaction between statisticians and psychologists&lt;/a&gt; but it applies just as much to statisticians helping scientists with their statistics, which is basically my job at the moment. Two of my colleagues in BRAG gave &lt;a href=&#34;http://bragqut.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/geospatial-visualisation/&#34;&gt;a really neat talk&lt;/a&gt; about using R to visualise spatial data. Maybe &lt;a href=&#34;http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/07/charlemagnes-dna-and-our-universal-royalty/&#34;&gt;Europe’s genetic history&lt;/a&gt; isn’t as diverse as we’d previously thought. They’re not all Habsburgs but there’s a little bit of Charlemagne in all of us. I helped a colleague hand in her PhD thesis recently; perhaps she should have read this beforehand: “&lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/05/22/how-not-to-hand-in-your-phd/&#34;&gt;How not to hand in your PhD&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
