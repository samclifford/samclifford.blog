      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lindsaybradford.wordpress.com/2013/07/25/the-database-design-goggles-they-do-nothing/&#34;&gt;Database design is important&lt;/a&gt;, especially if someone else has to work with your database. It’s not really something we teach in undergraduate science, perhaps the American model of requiring a certain number of credits from certain fields would help remedy this. Ever wanted a glimpse of &lt;a href=&#34;http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/bayes-notebook/&#34;&gt;Bayes’ notebook&lt;/a&gt;? Laura McInerney’s comments on the benefits of &lt;a href=&#34;http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/07/31/in-praise-of-the-small-conference/&#34;&gt;small conferences&lt;/a&gt; are similar to my experience with &lt;a href=&#34;http://bayesian.org/node/1657&#34;&gt;8 BNP&lt;/a&gt; in Veracruz, Mexico. As long as you’re within the niche field this sort of conference is a great experience. I felt a little like an outsider at 8 BNP because while I was interested in non-parametrics and was working on smoothing, a lot of people were working on things that I had no experience with which are actually the central elements of the field. I got to learn about a lot of neat things, hear some great talks and meet lots of amazing people, but I don’t think I was steeped in NP Bayes enough to really get the most out of the conference. My research went a bit away from NP Bayes these last few years so I didn’t get to put anything together for 9 BNP in Amsterdam. Perhaps ISBA 2014 in Cancún, Mexico will provide a bit more of a chance to get back to that work. We’re teaching R in SEB113. Perhaps any students reading this might be interested in these &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239799/60_R_resources_to_improve_your_data_skills&#34;&gt;60 R resources&lt;/a&gt;. I use multiple monitors at work but really enjoyed the virtual monitors setup in Gnome when I ran Ubuntu. &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/5616859/is-the-multiple+monitor-productivity-boost-a-myth&#34;&gt;It turns out&lt;/a&gt; that having a large canvas of pixels, rather than multiple monitors, is the key to workplace productivity. My work setup has two widescreen monitors side by side in portrait orientation. This doesn’t work particularly well with programs that assume you’re using a single landscape monitor (such as RStudio) or give you a single window with multiple documents inside that each have focus one at a time (Microsoft Office, why can’t I have a spreadsheet on each monitor?) but it means I don’t have to keep switching back and forth between TeXStudio and RStudio when I’m writing up my analysis. &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/article/Introduction-to-Ancient/140475/&#34;&gt;Flipped classes&lt;/a&gt; are an interesting model for education. I remember taking an Honours level mathematical modelling course a few years ago where the three hours of lecture time allocated us were used to discuss concepts and do modelling. We would read a chapter from the textbook in the lead-up to the class and then have a talk about what it meant and then work out a model based on a case study. I don’t know how well a truly flipped class would translate to a group bigger than about 30 students, but Sue Savage (QUT) tells me that the new lecture theatres in P block are designed to facilitate small group discussions within lectures. Daina Taimiņa explains &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1TBZhd-sN0&#34;&gt;hyperbolic geometry&lt;/a&gt; with crochet. Every once in a while something similar pops up and I can’t help but get excited. &lt;a href=&#34;http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/&#34;&gt;Daniel Hills recalls his memories&lt;/a&gt; of working with Richard Feynman on developing a massive parallel computer in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UPTECH is probably the biggest and most collaborative project my research group has ever embarked upon. Bringing together aerosol researchers at ILAQH, clinical medical scientists at the Woolcock Institute for Medical Research and international collaborators, it is likely to generate about fifty papers in the coming years. We currently have no system for keeping track of who is working on what and how developed each paper is. It’s probably too big for one or two investigators to keep in their head and I don’t think a Word document or Excel spreadsheet is going to cut it. I spent some time this afternoon mucking around in Microsoft Access in an attempt to figure out how I could put a relational database together that’s built well enough to capture information about authorship, where the authors come from, which journal or conference the paper is being submitted to, etc. but still be simple enough that the people in my group, who are not database experts (and I’m certainly not one), can manage to operate it fairly painlessly such that they’ll actually use it. I had a play with the “Projects” template but it was a bit too much, even though it did have some nice features such as the ability to import contact details from Outlook. I ended up making a table for papers and a table for people and set up a form for data entry. The “people” table feeds a drop down selection for lead author and a drop down multiple selection field for co-authors, which was quite simple to set up and is going to make things much easier. It works for the time being and I’ve got a few things I’d like to add, such as queries to return which papers a person is working on, how many lead author papers each person has, etc. it’s going to be a much more interesting way to learn about Access and databases than maintaining the utterly massive UPTECH database that was designed by someone else and then passed to me. Although if there are purpose built systems for this sort of thing I am more than willing to listen to what others use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time this morning with Tenzin, one of our PhD students, and Xuan Ling, a team member of ours who leaves us today, discussing the use of Access for Tenzin’s project. The last time I really paid much attention to databases was in 2000/2001 when my senior IPT class was learning about them. I learned SQL with MicroSQL (which I can’t find a reference to on Google) and while we did use Access to build a simple database it was only through the form and query point and click interface. So this morning’s meeting was me scribbling out database design a la Visio Modeller (before Microsoft bought it) to try and work out what sort of tables would be needed and then trying to figure out how on earth to build said tables. Tenzin’s way ahead of me here with the database from his pilot questionnaire and he’s got some very cool subdatasheet stuff going on. If I knew how Access works it would have been a much more productive meeting this morning but it was still good to try to figure it out together. I’ve had more success with getting R to talk to our big UPTECH database through ODBC. It’s the first time I’ve done anything like it and I’m managing, with some success, to get stuff into R. There are a few bizarre design choices in the database so it’s not as straightforward as it could be, but I can copy the text from the Access queries and get what I need. I’d much rather grab a chunk of data and process it in R than open Access, run some queries to get the data I want, save it as an Excel file, convert it to CSV and then load it into R.&lt;/p&gt;
