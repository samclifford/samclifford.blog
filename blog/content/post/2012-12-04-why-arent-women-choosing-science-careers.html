<p>[youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMwvNZMqUw0" class="uri">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMwvNZMqUw0</a>] One of my favourite video bloggers, Laci Green, talking about why women aren’t going into STEM fields. I’m quite fortunate to work with two research groups headed by women. There’s no sexism coming from the top of these groups and there are roughly even numbers of men and women in each group. Still, I know that not every university, nor every group within my university, has this sort of balance. Whether overt or covert there are still institutional barriers to equality of opportunity for women. P.S. that EC video campaign is terrible</p>
