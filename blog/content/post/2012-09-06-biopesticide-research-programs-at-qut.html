<p>The email below the cut details three PhD programs that are based on the level above me in the Biopesticides lab at QUT. All projects involve collaboration with researchers in the UK; the mathematics project involves collaborating with <a href="http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/contact/details/whites">researchers at Oxford</a> and the other two with researchers at <a href="http://www.cabi.org">CABI</a>.</p>
