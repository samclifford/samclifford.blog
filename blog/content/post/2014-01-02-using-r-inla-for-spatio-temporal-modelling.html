<p>Every once in a while I have to figure out how to do something in R-INLA. The easiest thing to do, obviously, is to see if anyone else has done the same thing before. Often they have and I am continually impressed by what INLA is capable of doing. I’m currently revising my paper on spatio-temporal modelling of outdoor PNC in the UPTECH project and the following papers have been incredibly helpful:</p>
