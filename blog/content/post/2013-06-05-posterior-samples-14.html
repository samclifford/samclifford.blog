<p><a href="http://themonkeycage.org/2013/05/29/how-to-make-an-academic-conference-and-more-accessible-and-more-interesting-live-streaming-and-conference-hashtags">Josh Tucker at the Monkey Cage</a> and <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/06/11/why-not-have-a-future-of-the-field-session-at-a-conference-with-only-young-speakers/">Jeff Leek at Simply Statistics</a> have some good ideas and goals as to how to make academic conferences more interesting. Opening up the conference with live streaming is a cheap way to engage the wider public (but risks potential attendees deciding to stay home and watch rather than engaging with the rest of the conference). A youth session is also a really good way to engage in some inter-generational communication by giving the younger researchers a stage for setting out their vision. <a href="http://f1000research.com/data-policies">These journals</a> wouldn’t view publication of data as prior publication when assessing an article based on that data. I spent last week in Sydney with Guy Marks’ group at the <a href="http://www.woolcock.org.au/">Woolcock Institute of Medical Research</a>. I first met Marks at Bayesian data analysis course run by Kerrie Mengersen; he <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/people/academics/profiles/guym.php">does work</a> on tuberculosis in Vietnam. Christian Robert, a collaborator of Mengersen’s, just gave 40 students in Ho Chi Minh City a crash course in Bayesian statistics. The slides are available <a href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/teaching-bayesian-statistics-in-hochimin-city/">here</a>. Speaking of Bayesian stats, the term “derp” is apparently a <a href="http://au.businessinsider.com/sorry-haters-derp-isnt-going-away-2013-6">Bayesian way of describing the way someone believes something so strongly</a> (their prior) that they can not be swayed by data. I’m going to be doing a lot more work teaching people how to use R in the near future. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239625/Beginner_s_guide_to_R_Introduction">This looks like a handy resource for beginners</a>.</p>
