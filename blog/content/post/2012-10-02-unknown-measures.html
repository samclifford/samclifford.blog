<p>I think it would be incredibly dorky, and thus incredibly cool (or incredibly hipster), to present some aerosol time series data in the same vein as the cover art for Joy Division’s “Unknown Pleasures”. <a href="unknown-pleasures-joy-division.jpg"><img src="http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/unknown-pleasures-joy-division.jpg" title="Joy Division &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot;" /></a>It’s actually quite an interesting way to visualise spatio-temporally correlated data, with either time or space as the grouping variable.</p>
