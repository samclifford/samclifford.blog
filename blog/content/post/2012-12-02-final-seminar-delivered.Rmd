I'll write up more about it later, as I've had a huge day and am exhausted, but today I gave my final seminar for my thesis. I probably went a little over time, but straddling the boundary of statistics and aerosol science means having two audience to pitch to. I got about half an hour of questions, mostly from the statisticians in the audience who wanted to know a bit more about the UPTECH study design, the spline fitting and why I didn't use a covariance function that doesn't imply preferred directions for smoothing. It's been a long journey and a tough couple of weeks as I put everything together. The panel was happy and have recommended some minor corrections. Then it's time to submit for external review.
