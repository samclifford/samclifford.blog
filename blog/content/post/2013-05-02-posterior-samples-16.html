<p>Something important to remember as a maths educator is that <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/04/math_teacher_explains_math_anxiety_and_defensiveness_it_hurts_to_feel_stupid.single.html">maths can make people feel stupid and people don’t like feeling stupid</a>. <a href="http://kottke.org/13/05/riding-an-icebreaker">Ever wondered what it’s like to spend two months on an ice-breaker?</a> The <a href="http://harvarddatascience.com/2013/05/05/harvard-stat-221-statistical-computing-and-visualization-all-lectures-online/">lecture slides from Harvard’s Stat 221 course</a> are all online now. Commander Chris Hadfield’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo">farewell from the ISS</a> is, fittingly, a cover of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”.</p>
