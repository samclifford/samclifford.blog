<p>The <a href="http://www.applieddatamining.info/">Applied Data Mining group</a> has an opening for a one year position as a research officer with the group, working on topics in data mining and machine learning (which appears to be a less rigorous Bayesian non-parametrics). So if you or someone you know is finishing a PhD in statistics, machine learning or computer science and knows how to do scientific computation/data mining for big data and wouldnâ€™t mind working in lovely, subtropical Brisbane, Australia for a year, email <a href="mailto:r.nayak@qut.edu.au">Associate Professor Richi Nayak</a> this week. Some selection criteria are under the cut. The successful application should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed the PhD (or nearly completed) with success as evidenced by publications in proceedings of important conferences and journals in the field of machine learning/ data mining;</li>
<li>Acquired a profound knowledge and practical experience in machine learning, data mining and information retrieval; experience with Big Data is an advantage.</li>
<li>Good programming skills (e.g., Java, C++, MATLAB, Python);</li>
<li>Experience with data mining tools such as WEKA, SAS, MSQLServer;</li>
<li>Excellent English language skills (written and spoken);</li>
<li>Good communication skills especially for interacting with industry partners;</li>
<li>The capability to work independently and in a team;</li>
</ul>
