<p>Dr Sam Clifford is an applied Bayesian statistician, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow and Associate Lecturer in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). He lectures SEB113 - Quantitative Methods for Science, the core first year mathematics and statistics unit for students enrolled in the ST01 Bachelor of Science. His research is with Professor Kerrie Mengersen and the <a href="https://bragqut.wordpress.com/">Bayesian Research and Applications Group.</a> His previous postdoctoral fellowship was funded jointly by the <a href="http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au/">International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health</a>, <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/institute-for-future-environments">Institute for Future Environments</a> and <a href="http://www.car-cre.org.au/">Centre for Air quality and health Research and evaluation (CAR-CRE)</a>. His PhD was conferred in 2013, completed within the <a href="http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au/">International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health</a> (QUT) under the supervision of <a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/morawska/">Professor Lidia Morawska</a>, <a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/mengerse/">Professor Kerrie Mengersen</a> and <a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/lowchoy/">Dr Sama Low Choy</a>. The topic of the thesis was <em><a href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/63528/">Spatio-temporal modelling of ultrafine particle number concentration</a></em>. His undergraduate background is in computational mathematics, mathematical modelling and applied physics. He holds a B AppSc (Mathematics) with Division II A Honours for his thesis on numerical modelling of dispersion in non-uniform flow. His research interests include</p>
