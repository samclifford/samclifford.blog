This morning I heard back from Annals of Applied Stats about the rejection of a paper I'd submitted there maybe a month ago. Again, the reviewer comments are insightful and helpful and will help improve the paper for its publication in an environmental science journal. I find that reading the reviewer comments is a great way to overcome the crushing feeling one gets as a young scientist when dealing with a letter of rejection of a paper.
