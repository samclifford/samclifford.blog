<p><a href="http://tenhundredwordsofscience.tumblr.com/">Ten Hundred Words of Science</a> is a really neat Tumblr inspired by the <a href="http://xkcd.com/1133/">XKCD explanation of the Up-goer five (Saturn V)</a>, for attempting to explain quite complex ideas in the ten hundred most common words of the English language (“thousand” did not make the list). <a href="http://tenhundredwordsofscience.tumblr.com/post/41236467291/my-work-is-to-look-at-the-air-around-schools-to">I have submitted an explanation of my own research</a>. <a href="http://bragqut.wordpress.com/">My stats reseach group</a> has decided to do a series of talks at its fortnightly meetings where presenters talk about visualisation. We’ve got a lot of people working on a variety of topics so it will be interesting to see how they present their data and data analysis. I’ve put my hand up (and my #3 supervisor’s) to do a talk about the principles of data visualisation. We’ve both read Tufte’s book and have a number of ideas about what constitutes a good graph. We’re considering a brief talk about the actual design principles and then some audience interaction where small groups are given a task such as critiquing a particular graph and suggesting changes. Good graph design and communication of ideas can always be focussed on. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2013/01/daily-chart-11">The Economist has a terrible graph</a> for what looks like the top 20 polluted cities but is actually a polluted city from the world’s 20 largest economies. In addition to being clearer about that, the graph should explicitly show the WHO standards and be on a log scale.</p>
