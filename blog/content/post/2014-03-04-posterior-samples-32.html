<p><a href="http://www.ntnu.edu/">NTNU</a> in Trondheim, Norway, has <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/r-inla.org/www/events/openphd-grants">five PhD fellowships</a> open. Visualising homicide rates in Mexico <a href="http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/02/26/excited-by-willingness-to-help-get-things-done/">using R and GitHub</a> (via <a href="http://www.statisticsblog.com/2014/03/the-week-in-stats-mar-3rd-edition/">Probability and Statistics Blog</a>). If you’re in Melbourne, Australia, you should consider popping along to <a href="http://thelaborastory.com/">Laborastory</a> at the Cider House (Brunswick), where five scientists get up on the first Tuesday of the month to tell the stories of the heroes and history of their field. A friend of mine went along this week and enjoyed it immensely. SEB113 has started again. I’ve already done 5 workshops (I have three a week). Introducing a whole new cohort of students to R, RStudio and ggplot. We did some paper plane throwing last week and had a look at how simple usage of faceting, colouring and stacking histograms can reveal both overall variation and group-to-group variation. A few students are still bewildered by the idea of writing code to make pictures but they recognise that it’s just a case of needing practice.</p>
