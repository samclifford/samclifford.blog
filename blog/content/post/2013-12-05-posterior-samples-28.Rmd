Hugh Possingham's lab at UQ is advertising four postdoc positions. [Two from an ARC Laureate Fellowship](http://uqjobs.uq.edu.au/jobDetails.asp?sJobIDs=495300&stp=AW) and [two through the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions](http://uqjobs.uq.edu.au/jobDetails.asp?sJobIDs=495304&stp=AW). The positions are three years full time and focus on mathematics and statistics rather than ecological fieldwork. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has [a postdoc position](http://martynplummer.wordpress.com/2013/12/10/postdoctoral-opportunity-at-iarc-2/) as well. I had my PhD graduation ceremony yesterday. [![IMG_2653a](http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2653a.jpg)](img_2653a.jpg)
