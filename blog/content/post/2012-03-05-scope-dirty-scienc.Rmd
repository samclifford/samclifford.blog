There's a second piece that came out of Channel Ten's visit to ILAQH a few months ago and it's about to go to air. Two other PhD students at ILAQH are featured in a piece for the Scope episode "Dirty Science". The show is aimed at a slightly older audience and the segment features me talking about dust storms, Leigh talking about (if I recall correctly) the instrumentation that we use to measure the physical and chemical properties of aerosols, and Lingli talking about particle deposition in the lung. The segment will air in the 4pm time slot on Thursday 29 March 2012.
