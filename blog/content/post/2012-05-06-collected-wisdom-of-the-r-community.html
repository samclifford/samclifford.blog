<p>Just for a bit of fun, I thought I might share with you the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fortunes/vignettes/fortunes.pdf"><em>fortunes</em></a> package from CRAN, containing some of the collected wisdom of the R community. My favourite, as someone who’s attempted to use <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BRugs/index.html"><em>BRugs</em></a> to fit Bayesian models in R using WinBUGS, is number 13 on the list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Thomas: . . . and if something goes wrong here it is probably not WinBUGS since that has been running for more than 10 years. . . Peter Green (from the back): . . . and it still hasn’t converged!</p>
