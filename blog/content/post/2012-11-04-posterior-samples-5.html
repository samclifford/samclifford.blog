<li><a href="http://musicmachinery.com/2012/11/12/the-infinite-jukebox/">It’s getting hammered at the moment, but The Infinite Jukebox analyses songs for similar phrases and builds a series of paths between similar sections so that you can have an infinitely long song.</a></li>
<li>The Infinite Jukebox reminds me a bit about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqzVSvqXJYg">Brian Eno’s work on generative systems</a> for rule-based music. This in turn reminds me of Brian Eno’s album “Discreet Music”, which features an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-Vq4pmzMaE">automatically played song and three re-arrangements of Pachelbel’s “Canon in D”.</a> The album is designed to sit in the background and be fairly unobtrusive, but it’s hard not to notice the familiar phrases of “Canon in D”. I find this album good as background music at work. The generative systems video above takes me back to my undergraduate studies in mathematics, where we learned about <a href="http://staff.qut.edu.au/staff/malletd/">mathematical modelling using cellular automata</a>.</li>
