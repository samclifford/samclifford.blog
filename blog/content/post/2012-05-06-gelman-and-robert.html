<p>Kerrie Mengersen, one of my supervisors, is visiting some colleagues in France at the moment. It appears that one of the outputs of this visit is a discussion paper, “In praise of the referee”, written with Nicolas Chopin, Andrew Gelman and Christian Robert (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4304">arXiv</a>). There’s been a lot of discussion recently about the role of journals, publishers and reviewers in academic publishing ranging from defending the <em>status quo</em> to totally overhauling the system by shedding paper journals and moving everything online to a distributed network of institutional ePrints repositories. The paper by Chopin et al. makes two recommendations after a lengthy discussion about where we find ourselves</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Post-publication peer review with comment threads on arXiv and/or a filtering service where instead of acting as reviewers, editorial boards pick out worthwhile new research as a list of recommended reading.</li>
<li>A reviewer commons where academics are taught how to review and the reviewer reports (and their names) are published alongside the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>The article is worth a read. I figured I’d also share an old Gelman blog post that he’s recently linked to, “<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2009/07/advice_on_writi/">Advice on writing research articles</a>”. The seven pieces of general advice are well worth remembering. It’s basically “Start with your conclusions and work backwards towards your methods”. Christian Robert has <a href="http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/25/xian-australian-tour-2012/">published the dates for his Australian tour</a>. I’m not particularly interested in ABC but the talk on Rao-Blackwellisation looks interesting. Anyone who’s interested in learning a bit about what Bayesian simulation is, without necessarily having a statistics background, would do well to attend the public talk entitled “Simulation as a universal tool for statistics”, which you could probably consider as a popular science talk.</p>
