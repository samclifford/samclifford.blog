I'm on leave next week so am attempting to spend today and tomorrow getting ready some things finished before I disappear. This means finishing my contribution to two papers by one of the UPTECH PhD students, finding a new home for our personal sampling paper (Environmental Health Perspectives didn't want it), getting SEB113 material ready for our 67 students next semester, contacting collaborators interstate about data, getting some Bayesian Network elicitation typed up and helping various PhD students with their data anlysis. It has been quite full on despite my supervisor being overseas.
