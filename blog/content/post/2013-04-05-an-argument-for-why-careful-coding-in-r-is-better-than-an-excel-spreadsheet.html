<p>I spend a fair amount of energy encouraging my coworkers to use R because you can write reusable code that means checking for errors is simple and you can re-run it on different data sets without having to manually copy and paste all your data and fix up any indexing if it’s the wrong length. There’s been a bit of buzz recently about how two economists really dropped the ball when they published a paper showing that high levels of national debt as a percentage of GDP slows economic growth. I won’t write any more about it because it’s been done by better writers and statisticians, but I’d like to bring your attention to the following articles:</p>

<li>There are many reasons to not use Excel, such as it providing the wrong answer for <a href="http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jsimonof/classes/1305/pdf/excelreg.pdf">paired t-tests</a> and <a href="http://or.nps.edu/faculty/PaulSanchez/oa4333/handouts/Excel/excel2000.pdf">being terrible at generating Normal random numbers</a>.</li>
</ul>
