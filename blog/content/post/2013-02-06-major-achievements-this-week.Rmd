*   <span style="line-height:12px;">final draft of final thesis paper ready to be submitted (pending feedback from one co-author)</span>
*   final draft of thesis ready to be submitted (pending feedback from one supervisor)
*   got the code working properly for a paper I'm second author on, looking at deposition of ultrafine particles within the lung. While not as big a coding task as the Finnish paper this has been a major slog over the last few weeks.
*   pretty much sorted out the analysis and graphs for the paper on fungal counts indoor and outdoor in the UPTECH (for which I'm author some way down the line)
*   appointment form submitted for my postdoc.
