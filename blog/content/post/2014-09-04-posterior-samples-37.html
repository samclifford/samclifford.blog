<p>SEB113 students really seemed to enjoy looking at mathematical modelling last week. <a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nM_X1PTccloC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;ots=dCzeaDpIeb&amp;dq=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&amp;f=false">The Lotka-Volterra equations</a> continue to be a good teaching tool. A student pointed out that when reviewing the limit idea for derivatives it’d be useful to show it with approximating the circumference of a circle using a polygon. So I knocked this up: <a href="https://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/approximations.png"><img src="approximations.png?w=300" alt="approximations" /></a> Are you interested in big data and/or air quality? <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/student-topics/big-data-and-nanoparticles-modelling-complex-spatio-temporal-variation">Consider doing a PhD with me</a>. This week I showed in the workshop how Markov chains are a neat application of linear algebra for dealing with probability. We used <a href="http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/">this interactive visualisation</a> to investigate what happens as the transition probabilities change. Zoubin Ghahramani has written <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1984/20110553.abstract">a really nice review paper</a> of Bayesian non-parametrics that I really recommend checking out if you’re interested in the new modelling techniques that have been coming out in the last few years for complex data sets. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/exercism/">Exercism.io</a> is a new service for learning how to master programming by getting feedback on exercises.</p>
