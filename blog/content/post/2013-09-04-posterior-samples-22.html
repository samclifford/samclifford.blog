<p>Roger Peng and Jeff Leek are going to be <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/08/29/the-return-of-the-stat-computing-for-data-analysis-data-analysis-back-on-coursera/">re-offering their Coursera courses</a> on data analysis, including the use of R. A Creative Commons-licensed textbook on Bayesian statistics that teaches in Python rather than mathematics? Sure. <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/thinkbayes.pdf">Have this one</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCuZ5UUrKrM">Let’s discuss gender bias in STEM fields</a>. Australia has a new government and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2013/09/10/3845442.htm">that new government has flagged</a> that it will be keeping a closer eye on the Australian Research Council’s grants process in order to “crack down on Labor’s (the former government) addition to waste by auditing increasingly ridiculous research grants”. The Liberal-National Party coalition government has a history of doing this; former Minister for Education, Brendan Nelson, <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2006/may/1294984634/gideon-haigh/nelson-touch">personally vetoed grants for humanities projects</a> that had been approved through the ARC’s independent peer review process.</p>
