[Because they're wrong](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/01/14/climate_change_another_study_shows_they_don_t_publish_actual_papers.html). In third year I took a physics elective which ended up steering me towards the group I did my PhD with. In a discussion about global climate models one of the other students, who was doing a non-science degree and also doing the unit as an elective, asked the lecturer "So is climate change actually real?" The answer wasn't given as curtly as the one above but it was just as simple "Yes, it is".
