SEB113 students really seemed to enjoy looking at mathematical modelling last week. [The Lotka-Volterra equations](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nM_X1PTccloC&lpg=PA111&ots=dCzeaDpIeb&dq=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q=lotka%20volterra%20fulford%20and%20barnes&f=false) continue to be a good teaching tool. A student pointed out that when reviewing the limit idea for derivatives it'd be useful to show it with approximating the circumference of a circle using a polygon. So I knocked this up: [![approximations](approximations.png?w=300)](https://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/approximations.png) Are you interested in big data and/or air quality? [Consider doing a PhD with me](https://www.qut.edu.au/research/our-research/student-topics/big-data-and-nanoparticles-modelling-complex-spatio-temporal-variation). This week I showed in the workshop how Markov chains are a neat application of linear algebra for dealing with probability. We used [this interactive visualisation](http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/) to investigate what happens as the transition probabilities change. Zoubin Ghahramani has written [a really nice review paper](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/1984/20110553.abstract) of Bayesian non-parametrics that I really recommend checking out if you're interested in the new modelling techniques that have been coming out in the last few years for complex data sets. [Exercism.io](http://www.wired.com/2014/09/exercism/) is a new service for learning how to master programming by getting feedback on exercises.
