<p>Hugh Possinghamâ€™s lab at UQ is advertising four postdoc positions. <a href="http://uqjobs.uq.edu.au/jobDetails.asp?sJobIDs=495300&amp;stp=AW">Two from an ARC Laureate Fellowship</a> and <a href="http://uqjobs.uq.edu.au/jobDetails.asp?sJobIDs=495304&amp;stp=AW">two through the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions</a>. The positions are three years full time and focus on mathematics and statistics rather than ecological fieldwork. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has <a href="http://martynplummer.wordpress.com/2013/12/10/postdoctoral-opportunity-at-iarc-2/">a postdoc position</a> as well. I had my PhD graduation ceremony yesterday. <a href="img_2653a.jpg"><img src="http://samcliffordinfo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/img_2653a.jpg" alt="IMG_2653a" /></a></p>
