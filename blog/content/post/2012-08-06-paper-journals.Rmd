My first issue of the official ISIAQ journal, [Indoor Air](http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-INA.html), arrived on my desk this morning. There are some interesting articles but I'm not particularly likely to thumb through a paper journal very often. I prefer getting an electronic copy where I can use the "Find" command to look for phrases and words in which I have a research interest. They offer an online version of the journal, so I wonder if I can contact ISIAQ and let them know I don't want a paper copy of the journal. Again, I think [Bayesian Analysis](http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/) is providing a good service by providing their journal as an online, Open Access resource. Edit: Oh no. I've just found a very bad graph. The below figure is from Batterman et al (2012) "[Sources, concentrations, and risks of naphthalene in indoor and outdoor air](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00760.x/full)". Plots based on empirical cumulative density functions should always be checked to ensure that the resulting functions are monotonic.

Sample size = 288 (Battermen et al., 2012)[/caption] Check the plot for Ypsilanti around 75-90%. Those dips should not be there. I'm guessing it's just a weird artifact of the way they generated the ecdf, but it's sloppy statistics and I can't believe the reviewer missed it. Indoor Air has an impact factor of 2.55 and was ranked as A* in 2010 by the [ARC](http://www.arc.gov.au/era/default.htm). I know the impact factor only relates to citations and it's one graph in a single issue but I always find this sort of thing disappointing.
