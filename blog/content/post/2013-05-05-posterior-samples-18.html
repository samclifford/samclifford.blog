<p>Some people make their visualisations in Excel, I make mine in R and others still use things like Processing or InDesign. Bret Victor <a href="http://vimeo.com/66085662">shows us</a> how the various ideas from each approach can be combined to make dynamic visualisations. It’s written with a view to <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2013/05/17/how-can-statisticians-help-psychologists-do-their-research-better/">the interaction between statisticians and psychologists</a> but it applies just as much to statisticians helping scientists with their statistics, which is basically my job at the moment. Two of my colleagues in BRAG gave <a href="http://bragqut.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/geospatial-visualisation/">a really neat talk</a> about using R to visualise spatial data. Maybe <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/07/charlemagnes-dna-and-our-universal-royalty/">Europe’s genetic history</a> isn’t as diverse as we’d previously thought. They’re not all Habsburgs but there’s a little bit of Charlemagne in all of us. I helped a colleague hand in her PhD thesis recently; perhaps she should have read this beforehand: “<a href="http://thesiswhisperer.com/2013/05/22/how-not-to-hand-in-your-phd/">How not to hand in your PhD</a>”.</p>
