I've been using Twitter for reading and our QUT Maths/Stats Slack domain for discussing maths, stats, data science, etc. over the last few months. So the way I use social media for work has changed a lot, and I've not been blogging as often. In any case, I figured there's enough random stuff I encounter floating around that it could be good to restart the info dump that is Posterior samples.

*   [Wilson et al. - Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037). I've noticed that I'm a lot more evangelical about people using git to collaboratively work on R-based analysis these days. Whether it's people a few desks or a few hundred kilometres away, getting your work up on a private github repository is going to make it easier for us to work together.

*   [The Trump administration seems to be deleting climate data](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/28/arctic-researcher-donald-trump-deleting-my-citations) (or at least stopping access to it).
*   [The Australian Medical Association is accusing celebrity chef (and paleo-evangelist) Pete Evans of giving unscientific medical advice that he's not qualified to give](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/mar/27/ama-accuses-pete-evans-of-endangering-lives-with-unscientific-health-advice).
*   Oh, and Dr Jack Wrigley, my lecturer for Advanced Calculus, Computational Mathematics 1 and Partial Differential Equations, dropped by to see how the School of Mathematical Sciences' new home was.
