Something important to remember as a maths educator is that [maths can make people feel stupid and people don't like feeling stupid](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/04/math_teacher_explains_math_anxiety_and_defensiveness_it_hurts_to_feel_stupid.single.html). [Ever wondered what it's like to spend two months on an ice-breaker?](http://kottke.org/13/05/riding-an-icebreaker) The [lecture slides from Harvard's Stat 221 course](http://harvarddatascience.com/2013/05/05/harvard-stat-221-statistical-computing-and-visualization-all-lectures-online/) are all online now. Commander Chris Hadfield's [farewell from the ISS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo) is, fittingly, a cover of David Bowie's "Space Oddity".
