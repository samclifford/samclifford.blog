<p>After ensuring that my colleagues were pushing their results to our git repository it’s now all steam ahead on this Finnish paper. I’ve got my MATLAB code running on the QUT supercomputer right now. It’s all very exciting watching it go and not run out of memory. Hopefully I can get these results sorted, do some model comparison, plotting and then send the document around for some final drafting within the next two or three weeks (the bulk of the theory section of the paper is finished). It would’ve been nice to be able to present this work at ISBA but I think I’d rather talk about the applied paper that discusses the spatio-temporal trends from the UPTECH project.</p>
