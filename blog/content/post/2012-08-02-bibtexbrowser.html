<p>Does anyone have any experience with <a href="http://www.monperrus.net/martin/bibtexbrowser">this</a>? The list of <a href="http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au/Misc/Publicat.htm">ILAQH publications</a> is a bit of a mess and I’d like to use it for my own page as well. I suspect ILAQH might need a new website. I notice there’s a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-publications/">Wordpress plugin</a> for it as well, which is nice. Edit: Two relevant links: <a href="http://wpmu.org/wordpress-com-vs-self-hosted-wordpress-what-you-need-to-know/">WordPress.com vs. Self-Hosted WordPress - What You Need To Know</a> and <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/convert-hosted-wordpress-blog-selfhosted-35266.html">How to Convert a Hosted WordPress Blog to Self-Hosted</a>. I suspect I’ll need to convert to a self-hosted installation to install bibtexbrowser, or at least fork out some money with Wordpress for the ability to install plugins (is that an option?) Edit 2: I might also have to drop $8.95/month on hosting (and $3.85/month for a unique IP) to set up Wordpress but at least my host/domain company offers it with a one click install.</p>
