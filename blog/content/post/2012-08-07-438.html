<p>I came across this via reddit’s r/statistics community and thought I might share it as a nice way of visualising posteriors. Specifically, it’s a very good demonstration of the convergence of the posterior beliefs of two observers with separate priors but the same data (which is sequentially collected, but the order of successes/failures are irrelevant). So next time someone’s telling you that Bayesian statistics is inherently wrong because of the subjectivity of the prior belief, you can point them to something like this to demonstrate that as data is collected the posteriors become quite close. I suggest having a play with the R code to understand how the diffuseness of the priors affects the concentration of posterior belief. While the opposite beliefs of the observers in the attached video are a nice example of convergence to the same posterior, I think two priors with the same mean and different variance would be a more interesting visualisation.</p>
