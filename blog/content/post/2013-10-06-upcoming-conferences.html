<p>It’s more a note for myself here but I’ve got an abstract accepted for <a href="http://emac2013.com.au/">EMAC2013</a>, discussing the modelling we did for personal sampling in the UPTECH project. <a href="http://isba2014.eventos.cimat.mx/node/72">ISBA 2014</a> abstracts close December 1. <a href="http://www.asc-ims2014.com/">ASC-IMS 2014</a> abstracts close October 30. I need to get abstracts for these conferences together. I’ll probably talk about UPTECH at ASC-IMS as it’s a conference with an Australian focus. I think ISBA 2014 I’ll try and present the modelling associated with the <a href="http://samclifford.info/2012/09/17/my-first-field-work/" title="My first field work">field work</a> I did about a year ago (we’re still writing the analysis).</p>
