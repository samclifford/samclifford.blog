<p>One of my supervisors, Sama Low Choy, is always up for a chat about the role of visualisation in statistics and data analysis. An acolyte of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Tufte</a>, Sama is quite passionate about appropriate methods of presenting data. 3D pie charts, needless to say, are public enemy number one. We were having a chat this afternoon about how <a href="http://conidialcoleopticide.wordpress.com/">a friend of mine</a> who’s about to start a Masters in biology/statistics is a bit of a nerd when it comes to the presentation of data and copy. Talk turned to how easy it is to use LaTeX and how there’s a need for better visualisation in scientific results (something I’ve talked to some of my ILAQH colleagues about at length). Infographics are quite a popular thing at the moment, despite not always being particularly informative nor warranted, and I mentioned <a href="http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com">a blog about the process that the New York Times crew go through when developing infographics</a> and other visualisation tools. Sama has forwarded me an email containing some of her favourite links that deal with the field of “data journalism”.</p>
