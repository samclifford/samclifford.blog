<p>This morning I booked my flights to Osaka ($670 return, a very good deal) and am in the process of organising accommodation with <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~tab/">Tamara Broderick</a>. I’m getting excited about catching up with the various people that I met at the BNP conference last year and it’s even more exciting to see their names on the list of people giving talks. Tamara will be talking about Beta processes and Sergio Bacallado is giving a talk alongside Sonia Petrone and Yee Whye Teh, two of the big names in Bayesian non-parametrics. A few QUT people are talking as well. Nicole White and Susanna Cramb will be talking about spatio-temporal disease modelling. One of my supervisors, Sama Low Choy, will be talking about combining subjective priors (expert elicitation) and another, Kerrie Mengersen, is organising that session and co-author on a few papers that are being presented by people in her BRAG group, as well as posters (such as mine). I’m also looking forward to seeing presentations on INLA, spatial modelling, non-parametric estimation and environmental modelling.</p>
