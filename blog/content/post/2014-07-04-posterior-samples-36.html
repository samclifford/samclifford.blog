<p>Interested in collaborative use of R, MATLAB, etc. for analysis and visualisation within a webpage? <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/msund/403910de45e282d658fa">Combining plotly and iPython</a> can help you with that. Cosmopolitan (yes, <em>that</em> Cosmopolitan) has <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/news/a29534/get-that-life-emily-graslie-science/">a great article</a> interviewing Emily Graslie, Chief Curiosity Officer at the Field Museum in Chicago. She discusses being an artist and making the transition into science, science education and YouTube stardom. A few of the PhD students in my lab have asked if I could run an introduction to R session. I’d mentioned the CAR workshop that I’d be doing but the cost had put them off. Luckily, there are alternatives like <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r">Datacamp</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="http://www.lynda.com/R-tutorials/R-Statistics-Essential-Training/142447-2.html">Lynda</a>. Coursera’s next round of “Data Science”, delivered by Johns Hopkins University, starts next Monday (Course 1 - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1">R Programming</a>). So get in there and learn some R! I’m considering recommending some of these Coursera courses to my current SEB113 students who want to go a bit further with R, but the approach that they take in these online modules is quite different to what we do in SEB113 and I don’t want them to confuse themselves.</p>
